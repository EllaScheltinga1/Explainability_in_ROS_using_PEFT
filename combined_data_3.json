Even after executing all recovery behaviors.\"\n\nFinally, the log states \"Failed to reach waypoint 5\", which confirms that the path to waypoint 5 was not feasible."

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Failed to get a plan**: The robot was unable to generate a path to its destination, which often indicates that the path is blocked or the planning algorithm cannot find a feasible route.\n\n2. **Clearing costmaps**: The robot attempted to clear its costmaps (both large and small squares), a procedure typically used to remove obstacles or erroneous sensor data from the navigation grid. This action suggests that there were obstacles detected by the sensors that the robot tried to ignore or re-evaluate.\n\n3. **Rotate recovery behavior started**: This indicates that the robot executed a recovery behavior designed to handle local obstacles. A common recovery behavior is rotating in place to find a new, obstacle-free path.\n\n4. **Aborting because a valid plan could not be found**: Despite the recovery attempts, the robot still could not find a valid path to the goal, leading to the conclusion that persistent obstacles or navigation issues prevented successful planning.\n\nOverall, the consistent failure to generate a plan and the activation of recovery behaviors indicate that the robot likely encountered obstacles during the navigation task."

Even after executing all recovery behaviors\" confirms that obstacles likely prevented the creation of a viable path.\n\n2. **Waypoint 4:**\n   - Similar to waypoint 2, the log entry \"Failed to get a plan.\" indicates an issue with path planning for the goal coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-10.5).\n   - Recovery behaviors were attempted again, clearing costmaps and performing a rotate recovery behavior, but failed to resolve the issue.\n   - The process ended with \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors,\" indicating persistent obstacles.\n\nThese obstacles resulted in the robot being unable to reach waypoints 2 and 4 despite multiple recovery attempts."

The failure at Waypoint 3 included recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotate recovery, but a valid plan could not be determined to reach the final waypoint."

The actions in the log indicate that the robot was required to move to specific coordinates (waypoints) and perform navigation tasks. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Waypoint Navigation**: The log shows the robot being sent goals to reach specific coordinates, such as:\n   - Waypoint 1: \\((x=1.0, y=0.0)\\)\n   - Waypoint 2: \\((x=-4.5, y=1.5)\\)\n   - Waypoint 3: \\((x=2.0, y=1.0)\\)\n   - Waypoint 4: \\((x=0.0, y=-5.0)\\)\n   - Waypoint 5: \\((x=1.0, y=-9.0)\\)\n\n2. **Navigation Status**: The log messages include status updates like \"Navigating to waypoint X...\", \"GOAL Reached!\", and \"Failed to reach waypoint Y,\" which detail the progress and outcome of each navigation attempt.\n\n3. **Recovery Actions**: Some waypoints triggered recovery behaviors due to oscillations or failure to generate a valid plan, indicating the robot's attempt to autonomously adjust and continue its task.\n\n4. **Interaction with move_base**: The robot interacts with the `move_base` action server to perform the navigation, which is a common ROS component for autonomous navigation tasks.\n\nThus, the robot's primary task was to autonomously navigate to and reach a sequence of specified waypoints."

        "answers": "Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot's task involved autonomous navigation to different waypoints. The log shows the robot receiving and attempting to navigate to specific goal locations (waypoints) given as coordinates (x, y).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The robot initializes with various controllers for its joints, sensors, and movement systems.\n2. It waits for and then connects to the `move_base` action server, which is responsible for high-level commands to move the robot to specified locations.\n3. The robot attempts to navigate to several waypoints in sequence, specified by coordinates:\n   - Waypoint 1: `x = -0.5, y = -2.0` (Failed to reach due to inability to find a valid plan even after recovery behaviors)\n   - Waypoint 2: `x = 2.0, y = -7.0` (Reached successfully)\n   - Waypoint 3: `x = 0.0, y = -8.0` (Reached successfully)\n   - Waypoint 4: `x = -3.5, y = -8.5` (Reached successfully)\n\nThe log messages indicate transitions between different states (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) as the robot attempts to reach each waypoint, handle failures, and ultimately confirms when it reaches the successful waypoints.\n\n### In summary:\nThe robot's task was primarily to execute autonomous navigation, successfully traversing various specified waypoints while handling any navigation and planning challenges encountered along the way."

Despite this, the log again indicates, \"Failed to get a plan.\"\n\n4. **Final Abortion**: After executing all recovery behaviors and still being unable to devise a feasible path, the system logs, \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found.\"\n\nGiven these details, the reasons why the path to waypoint 5 was not feasible could include:\n- **Presence of Obstacles**: There could be static or dynamic obstacles in the environment that the robot's planners could not navigate around.\n- **Incorrect or Incomplete Mapping**: The robot's map might be inaccurate or incomplete, leading to incorrect planning outcomes.\n- **Complex Terrain**: The terrain between the robot's current position and waypoint 5 might be too complex for the robot to find a traversable path.\n\nUltimately, the combination of these factors led to the planning algorithm's failure to find a valid path, triggering the recovery behaviors, and eventually resulting in the abortion of the goal to reach waypoint 5."

Clearing the costmaps was an attempt to remove these impediments, but it wasn\u2019t sufficient.\n\n4. **Abortion Due to Infeasibility**:\n    - The robot ultimately transitioned to \"ABORTING\" because even after all recovery behaviors, a valid plan could not be obtained. This strongly suggests that the environment might have been dynamically changing, or there were insurmountable obstacles that made any direct or navigable path infeasible.\n\nIn summary, the robot was unable to find a feasible path due to initial and persistent planning failures, even after executing multiple recovery actions.

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "The log messages provide several indications as to why the robot failed to find feasible paths to certain waypoints:\n\n1. **Costmap Clearing Attempts**: For both waypoints 1 and 2, the robot attempted to clear the costmaps outside squares of varying sizes (3.00m and 1.50m) centered on itself. This is a common practice to handle potentially stale or incorrect obstacle data. The repeated clearing suggests that the robot encountered obstacles or environmental data that it couldn't navigate around.\n\n2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: The logs indicate that the \"rotate recovery behavior\" was initiated during attempts to reach both waypoints 1 and 2. This behavior typically tries to re-orient the robot to escape from difficult or stuck scenarios, indicating that the robot was having significant trouble in those areas.\n\n3. **Failed to Get a Plan**: On multiple occasions, the log states \"Failed to get a plan.\" This shows that the path planning algorithms (likely using A* or Dijkstra's algorithm) were unable to generate a viable path given the current map and sensor data, reinforcing that there may have been either insurmountable obstacles, incorrect map data, or dynamic changes in the environment making path planning infeasible.\n\n4. **Final Abort Decision**: After executing all available recovery behaviors, the system still failed to obtain a valid plan, leading to the decisions to abort. This corroborates the likelihood of complex, unresolvable environmental conditions or data inconsistencies.\n\nThe successful navigation to waypoint 3 implies that the area en route to this waypoint was less complicated, allowing the planning algorithms to generate a feasible path.\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of paths to waypoints 1 and 2 is due to the presence of obstacles, potentially out-of-date or erroneous map data, or dynamic environmental changes which the robot's recovery behaviors were unable to handle."

There are several potential reasons why the planning algorithm might have failed:\n\n1. **Environmental Obstacles**: The area might have been obstructed by dynamic or static objects, making it impossible to find a collision-free path.\n2. **Costmap Issues**: The local or global costmaps may have been overly inflated, improperly configured, or contained stale data that misrepresented the environment.\n3. **Insufficient Map Data**: The robot\u2019s map data might not have been comprehensive enough to cover the area around the first waypoint, leading to planning failures.\n4. **Navigation Configuration**: The navigation parameters, such as allowable obstacle clearance, maximum planning attempts, and allowable path cost, might not have been appropriately tuned.\n5. **Sensor Errors**: Faulty sensor data (e.g., from the IMU or force-torque sensors) could have led to incorrect perceptions of the environment, causing planning to fail.\n\nThe robot attempted recovery behaviors, such as clearing the costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior, but these efforts were unsuccessful in resolving the issue. Consequently, the navigation system aborted the goal as it could not compute a valid plan despite these recovery attempts.\n\nThe successful attainment of goals 2 and 3 implies that the planning algorithm and navigation stack were capable of functioning correctly under different conditions or locations, highlighting that the issue was likely specific to the environment or constraints around waypoint 1."

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "Based on the ROS log messages provided, there are several instances where the robot was unable to reach certain waypoints. The reasons for the infeasibility of the paths can be inferred from the logs:\n\n1. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 2**:\n    - **Oscillation Detected**: The log indicates that a possible oscillation of the robot or its local plan was detected by `TebLocalPlannerROS`. Oscillation often implies that the robot is struggling to decide on a clear path or is repeatedly trying to move back and forth without making progress.\n    - **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot attempted recovery strategies, including clearing costmaps (removing obstacles and updating the map) and executing a rotate recovery behavior. However, these efforts were unsuccessful.\n    - **Aborting Due to Persistent Oscillation**: Ultimately, the robot aborted the attempt because it kept oscillating despite executing all recovery behaviors.\n\n2. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 3**:\n    - **Failed to Get a Plan**: The log explicitly states that the robot failed to get a valid navigation plan. This likely indicates that the global planner could not find a feasible path from the robot\u2019s current location to the waypoint, possibly due to obstacles, narrow passages, or unreachable areas.\n    - **Recovery Behaviors Again Unsuccessful**: Similar to Waypoint 2, the robot tried clearing costmaps and performing rotate recovery behavior but couldn\u2019t make any progress.\n    - **Aborting Due to Invalid Plan**: After multiple attempts, the system aborted the navigation effort as a valid plan could not be found even after executing recovery strategies.\n\nIn both failed cases, the infeasibility of the paths can be attributed to:\n- **Oscillations and Local Planning Failures**: The robot got stuck in a loop trying to resolve its local path, which prevented it from moving toward the goal smoothly.\n- **Inability to Generate a Valid Plan**: For Waypoint 3 specifically, the global planner was unable to find any feasible path, suggesting the area may be inaccessible or too complex for the robot to navigate given its current configuration and sensor data.\n\nIn contrast, the successful navigations (Waypoints 1, 4, and 5) did not encounter these issues, indicating relatively clear and navigable paths to those targets."

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "The log messages indicate that the autonomous robot encountered difficulties in finding viable paths to navigate towards the waypoint. Here are the key reasons for the infeasibility of the paths:\n\n1. **Failure to Get a Plan**:\n   - The first indication of a problem is the log entry: \"Failed to get a plan.\" This suggests that the path planning algorithm could not generate a valid trajectory from the robot's current position to the goal coordinates (x=-0.5, y=-2.0).\n\n2. **Clearing Costmaps**:\n   - The robot attempted to clear the costmaps twice, first with a square 3.00 meters and then 1.50 meters centered on the robot. Clearing the costmaps is typically a recovery behavior to eliminate potential obstacles from the map that might not exist or to deal with transient issues like sensor noise.\n\n3. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n   - Despite the costmaps being cleared, the robot still failed to generate a plan. The log mentions the initiation of a \"Rotate recovery behavior,\" which is another attempt to recover from planning failures by rotating the robot to scan for viable paths.\n\n4. **Final Plan Failure**:\n   - After executing all recovery behaviors, the log concludes with \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors\". This definitively shows that every attempt to find a valid path\u2014through replanning and recovery behaviors\u2014was unsuccessful.\n\n5. **Environmental Constraints**:\n   - The repeated failure to generate a plan and the eventual need to abort suggest there could be significant environmental constraints that the robot\u2019s sensors and algorithms deemed impassable. These could include obstacles, narrow passages, or other navigation hazards that the robot's system could not find a way around.\n\nIn summary, the paths were not feasible mainly due to the robot's inability to generate a valid plan, even after multiple attempts at recovery, likely due to insurmountable obstacles or challenging environment features in the robot's immediate vicinity."

Hence, the attempt was aborted (`Aborting because a valid plan could not be found, even after executing all recovery behaviors`).\n\nIn summary, the robot's paths were not feasible due to persistent planning failures, likely caused by obstructed or complex terrain that couldn't be resolved through recovery strategies.

        "answers": "The logs indicate that the robot attempted to navigate to two waypoints but failed to generate feasible paths. Here are the probable reasons for the failed path planning:\n\n1. **Failed to Get a Plan:**\n   - Several instances of \"Failed to get a plan\" indicate that the path planning algorithms were unable to find a valid path to the target waypoints. This can occur due to various reasons, such as inadequate or blocked paths, obstacles in the environment, or map inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Recovery Behaviors:**\n   - The logs show multiple attempts to clear the costmaps and perform rotate recovery behavior. Specifically:\n     - **Clearing Costmaps:** The system tried to clear potential obstacles around the robot by clearing out larger (3.00m) and smaller (1.50m) squared areas centered on the robot.\n     - **Rotate Recovery:** This behavior involves rotating in place to help the sensors get a better view of the surroundings and potentially find an obstacle-free path.\n   - Despite these efforts, the planner still failed to find a viable path, indicating that the issues could not be resolved with these recovery methods.\n\n3. **Environmental Factors:**\n   - Obstacles too close to the robot or throughout the planned path could have impeded successful pathfinding.\n   - There might have been dynamic or static obstacles that weren't accounted for in the robot's map or were too challenging for the planner to navigate around.\n\n4. **Map or Localization Issues:**\n   - If the robot's map was inaccurate, outdated, or the robot's localization was off, the path planner could struggle to create a correct trajectory.\n   - Sensor malfunctions or inaccuracies could lead to erroneous obstacle detection or misplacement in the map.\n\n5. **Insufficient Parameter Adjustments:**\n   - Parameters governing the costmap clearing or the planner's algorithm might have been insufficient for the complexity of the environment.\n   - Parameters like the size of the cleared area or the duration of rotate behavior could have been inadequate, preventing the creation of a valid path.\n\nIn summary, the paths were not feasible due to the planner's inability to generate a valid path despite attempts to clear costmaps and perform recovery behaviors. This likely stems from environmental obstacles, map or localization errors, or insufficient parameter settings."

This indicates that there could have been significant obstacles or environmental constraints in the area surrounding waypoint 2 that the robot could not navigate around or through."

Here are the key details explaining why the path to waypoint 3 was not feasible:\n\n1. **Failed to get a plan**: The robot's navigation stack could not generate a path from its current location to the goal at waypoint 3. This can happen due to a plethora of reasons such as obstacles, configuration issues, etc.\n\n2. **Clearing costmaps**: To attempt to resolve the planning issue, the robot performed costmap clearing actions:\n   - The costmaps were cleared outside a 3.00m square centered on the robot.\n   - The costmaps were again cleared outside a 1.50m square centered on the robot. Costmaps are representations of the environment which include obstacles and space. Clearing them helps in recalculating a potential new path by removing potentially outdated or erroneous data.\n\n3. **Recovery behaviors**: The robot executed a \"Rotate recovery behavior\" which is a common method to try and get unstuck by rotating to scan the environment for a feasible path.\n\n4. **Persistent failure**: Despite these recovery attempts, the robot again failed to generate a valid plan and eventually aborted the task.\n\n5. **Aborting due to no valid plan**: The repeated failures to generate a valid path and the unsuccessful execution of recovery behaviors led to the final decision to abort the planning attempt.\n\nIn summary, the reason for the infeasibility of the path to waypoint 3 was the navigation stack's inability to generate a valid path due to potential obstacles or other environmental factors, despite attempting costmap clearing and recovery behaviors."

This is a common issue in path planning, potentially due to map obstacles, configuration space restrictions, or dynamic changes in the environment.\n\n3. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n   - Recovery behaviors such as \"Clearing both costmaps\" and \"Rotate recovery behavior\" were initiated to address the planning failure. These actions usually clear obstacles or help the robot reorient itself to find an alternative path.\n\n4. **Final Outcome**:\n   - Despite executing all recovery behaviors, the planner still couldn't find a valid plan: \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found.\"\n\nThe non-feasibility of the path could arise from several factors:\n- **Obstacles**: Static or dynamic obstacles in the robot's path that the planner could not navigate around.\n- **Costmap Issues**: The local or global costmaps might contain incorrect or outdated obstacle information, making planning difficult.\n- **Configuration Space**: The waypoint might be in a part of the environment that's confined or has narrow passages that the robot can't navigate.\n- **Planner Limitations**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` might have limitations under certain conditions that were met at waypoint 2.\n\nAddressing this issue might involve reviewing the environment's obstacle configuration, ensuring the costmaps are up-to-date, and potentially tuning the planner\u2019s parameters for better feasibility."

        "answers": "From the ROS log messages provided, it is clear that the autonomous robot encountered issues in navigating to certain waypoints. Here are the reasons behind the infeasibility of the paths for waypoints 2 and 4:\n\n1. **Waypoint 2 (x=2.5, y=-5.5)**:\n   - The robot initially failed to get a plan.\n   - The system attempted recovery behaviors, which included clearing both costmaps outside squares centered on the robot (first 3.00m and then 1.50m).\n   - Rotate recovery behavior was executed as well.\n   - Despite these recovery efforts, the robot again failed to generate a valid plan.\n   - Ultimately, it aborted the goal due to the inability to find a feasible path, even after executing all recovery behaviors.\n\n   **Reason**: The area around waypoint 2 likely had obstacles or a complex environment that made path planning infeasible. The recovery behaviors (clearing costmaps and rotating) were not sufficient to resolve the obstacle issues or environmental complexities.\n\n2. **Waypoint 4 (x=-3.5, y=-10.5)**:\n   - Similar to waypoint 2, the robot failed to get a plan initially.\n   - Recovery behaviors were again executed, including clearing costmaps and the rotate recovery behavior.\n   - However, it once more failed to come up with a feasible plan even after these actions.\n   - The robot aborted the goal after these attempts failed.\n\n   **Reason**: The situation for waypoint 4 mirrors that of waypoint 2. The environmental conditions around this point likely had obstacles or complexities that the robot's path planning algorithms could not overcome, leading to the inability to find a viable path.\n\nIn summary, for both waypoints 2 and 4, the robot could not generate feasible paths due to obstacles or difficult terrain in the environment that couldn't be overcome by standard recovery behaviors."

        "answers": "The ROS log messages indicate that the robot encountered issues with navigating to waypoint 1, resulting in the path being deemed not feasible. Here are the key reasons for the infeasibility:\n\n1. **Failed to Get a Plan**: The log explicitly mentions \"Failed to get a plan,\" which is indicative of the navigation system being unable to find a valid path from the robot's current position to the designated waypoint (x=-2.5, y=-2.0).\n\n2. **Costmap Clearing Procedures**: The robot attempted to clear its costmaps\u2014first in a larger square (3.00m) and then in a smaller square (1.50m) centered on the robot. This suggests that the initial costmap might have contained obstacles or invalid data affecting path planning. Despite these attempts to update the local environment data and remove potential obstacles, the planning still failed.\n\n3. **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot executed a \"rotate recovery behavior,\" which is a common procedure to reorient and attempt to find a valid path after initial failures. Even with this recovery behavior, the log indicates another failure to get a plan, leading to the final decision that the waypoint was unreachable.\n\nThese factors cumulatively indicate that obstacles or environment constraints hindered the robot's ability to find a viable route to waypoint 1, causing the path planning to fail despite multiple recovery attempts. In contrast, the path to waypoint 2 was feasible, as indicated by the successful goal achievement without reported obstacles or planning failures."

This typically involves the robot rotating in place to scan its surroundings, hoping to find a valid path by re-evaluating the environment from a different perspective.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot was unable to generate a valid path. Consequently, it aborted the navigation task and transitioned through various states indicating the failure:\n\n- **WAITING_FOR_RESULT:** This state indicates the robot was waiting to see if the recent actions (costmap clearing and recovery behaviors) resolved the issue.\n- **DONE:** Finally, the robot transitioned to the DONE state, signaling the end of the navigation attempt because a valid plan could not be found even after executing all recovery behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the robot's approach to handling unfeasible paths involved clearing costmaps to remove potential obstacles and performing a rotate recovery behavior to reassess the environment, but these measures were ultimately unsuccessful."

Here are the steps the robot took to deal with the unfeasible paths:\n\n1. **Failed to Get a Plan**: Initially, when the robot failed to obtain a valid plan to the desired waypoint, it did not immediately give up.\n\n2. **Clearing Costmaps**: It cleared both local and global costmaps in two different stages: first, outside a square 3.00 meters large, and second, outside a square 1.50 meters large centered on the robot. This action is aimed at eliminating any erroneous or outdated information about the surroundings that might be obstructing path planning.\n\n3. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: It activated a rotate recovery behavior, which involves the robot rotating on the spot to potentially identify a new feasible path by perceiving its environment from different angles.\n\n4. **Repeating the Plan Attempt**: After performing these recovery steps, the robot attempted again to get a plan. \n\n5. **Aborting the Goal**: When these recovery behaviors (clearing costmaps and rotating) did not lead to a successful plan, the robot aborted the mission for the specific waypoint. This is indicated by the transition to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` followed by `DONE` with the status of the goal as failed.\n\nThese steps were repeated for each unsuccessful goal attempt until the robot was eventually able to navigate successfully to a feasible waypoint (waypoint 3)."

        "answers": "When the robot encountered unfeasible paths, its behavior and subsequent actions were as detailed in the logs:\n\n1. **Initial Attempt to Navigate**: The robot started by sending its first goal to the `move_base` action server with coordinates \\( x=2.0 \\) and \\( y=1.0 \\).\n\n2. **Failed to Get a Plan**: The navigation system failed to generate a valid plan to reach the first waypoint. This failure was acknowledged by the message \"Failed to get a plan.\"\n\n3. **Recovery Behavior \u2013 Clearing Costmaps**: In an attempt to recover from this failure, the robot executed a recovery behavior. Specifically, it cleared both costmaps (the mapping of obstacles) within squares centered on the robot, first with a size of 3.00m and then with a size of 1.50m. This step is often done to clear any potentially stale or inaccurate data that could be obstructing the planning process.\n\n4. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: After clearing the costmaps, the robot engaged in a \"Rotate recovery behavior.\" This typically involves rotating the robot in place to help with re-localizing itself in the environment and potentially clearing any immediate minor obstacles.\n\n5. **Repeated Failed Plan**: Despite the recovery behaviors, the robot still failed to generate a feasible plan. This is indicated by the repeated message \"Failed to get a plan.\"\n\n6. **Aborting the Goal**: After all recovery behaviors were exhausted without success, the system aborted the goal with the message \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors.\" This indicates that the robot's navigation system could not find any feasible path to the initial waypoint.\n\n7. **Transitioning Back to Waiting and Reporting Failure**: Once aborted, the robot transitioned back to the state `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` and subsequently to `DONE` with the log message \"Failed to reach waypoint 1.\"\n\nIn summary, the robot attempted several recovery strategies such as clearing costmaps and performing a rotate recovery. Once those strategies failed to yield a feasible path, it aborted the effort and reported the failure to reach the waypoint."

        "answers": "The robot employed a series of recovery strategies when it encountered unfeasible paths:\n\n1. **Recovery Strategies Activation**: When the `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected possible oscillation (either in the robot's movement or its local plan), it activated a recovery strategy. Specifically, it tried to prefer the current turning direction during optimization.\n\n2. **Costmap Clearing**: The robot attempted to clear obstacles by clearing costmaps (maps that indicate obstacles) in different-sized squares centered on the robot. Initially, a 3.00m square was cleared, followed by a 1.50m square.\n\n3. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: The robot engaged in a rotate recovery behavior, which typically involves rotating on the spot to try to find a new viable path out of the oscillatory state or to re-evaluate its surroundings.\n\n4. **Abort Mission on Oscillation**: If the robot continued to oscillate (repeatedly move back and forth without making progress) despite executing these recovery behaviors, it aborted the current navigation goal. This happened when attempting to reach waypoint 2.\n\n5. **Abort Mission on Plan Failure**: If the robot failed to generate a valid plan even after executing all recovery behaviors, it also aborted the current navigation goal. This occurred when attempting to reach waypoint 3.\n\nDespite these recovery attempts, the robot was unable to reach waypoint 2 due to persistent oscillation and waypoint 3 due to an inability to generate a valid plan. However, it successfully reached other waypoints either without the need for recovery strategies or after the initial recovery attempts worked."

This involves the robot performing a rotational movement in place to scan the environment afresh, helping it to re-evaluate its surroundings and possibly find a new feasible path.\n\nDespite these recovery attempts, the robot was still unable to generate a valid plan. It then proceeded to abort the task, transitioning back through its state machine to \"WAITING_FOR_RESULT,\" and ultimately to \"DONE,\" indicating it had stopped trying to reach the waypoint and declared the mission as failed.\n\nIn summary, the robot dealt with the unfeasible path by clearing its costmaps and performing a rotate recovery behavior.

        "question": "How did the robot deal with unfeasible path(s)?",
        "answers": "When the robot encountered unfeasible paths during its attempts to navigate to waypoints 1 and 2, it employed several recovery behaviors and strategies to try and resolve the navigation issues:\n\n1. **Clearing Costmaps**:\n   - The robot first attempted to clear obstacles and other data from its costmaps. Specifically, it cleared both local and global costmaps within a 3.00m and then a 1.50m radius centered on the robot. Costmap clearing is a common strategy to remove potentially erroneous or outdated data that might be obstructing path planning.\n\n2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**:\n   - After clearing the costmaps, the rotate recovery behavior was initiated. This involves the robot rotating in place to potentially escape from localized obstacles or to update its sensor data for a better understanding of its surroundings.\n\n3. **Failure to Get a Plan**:\n   - Despite these efforts, the robot reported \"Failed to get a plan\" indicating that the path planning algorithms were still unable to find a feasible route to the goal.\n\n4. **Aborting the Plan**:\n   - After attempted recovery behaviors (costmap clearing and rotation) failed to yield a feasible path, the robot aborted the current navigation goal. This indicates a termination of the attempt to reach the waypoint due to the inability to find a valid plan.\n\nFor both waypoints (x=-1.5, y=-4.5) and (x=-3.5, y=-7.0), the robot repeated the above steps but ultimately did not succeed in finding a valid path, resulting in failures to reach both waypoints."

        "answers": "When the robot encountered unfeasible paths during its navigation, it undertook several specific recovery behaviors to try and find a feasible path. Here's how the robot dealt with such situations:\n\n1. **Trajectory Feasibility Check:** When attempting to navigate to the second and third waypoints, the robot's local planner (TebLocalPlannerROS) identified that the trajectory was not feasible.\n   \n2. **Resetting Planner:** Upon detecting an unfeasible trajectory, the planner was reset to attempt to find an alternative path.\n\n3. **Clearing Costmaps:** The robot performed actions to clear its costmaps:\n   - It first cleared costmaps outside a 3.00-meter square centered on the robot.\n   - Following that, it cleared costmaps outside a 1.50-meter square centered on the robot. \n\n4. **Rotate Recovery Behavior:** As part of its recovery strategy, the robot initiated a rotate recovery behavior, which is a maneuver to help the robot reorient and potentially find a new viable path.\n\nDespite these recovery attempts, the robot was unable to find a valid plan to reach Waypoint 2 and ultimately aborted the navigation for that specific goal.\n\nFor Waypoint 3, similar steps were followed, including the local planner resetting due to an unfeasible trajectory. However, this time the recovery actions were successful, and the robot eventually reached the waypoint.\n\nIn summary, the robot's strategy for dealing with unfeasible paths involved resetting its local planner, clearing costmaps to remove potentially problematic obstacles, and executing rotate recovery behaviors to reorient itself and attempt to identify a viable path."
