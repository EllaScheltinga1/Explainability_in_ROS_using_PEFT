The coordinates of all the waypoints the robot received are:

1. Waypoint 1: x = -1.0, y = 1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x = -4.0, y = -1.0
3. Waypoint 3: x = -2.0, y = 0.0
4. Waypoint 4: x = 2.0, y = -2.0
5. Waypoint 5: x = 1.0, y = -6.0

These coordinates are based on the goals sent to `move_base` in the log messages.
