Yes, the robot encountered an obstacle during the navigation task. Specifically, while navigating to waypoint 2 (coordinates x=-4.0, y=-4.5), a new obstacle was detected at position (-3.0, -5.0). The log indicates multiple instances where the robot's path had to be replanned due to the obstacle. Additionally, there were issues with the trajectory being not feasible and possible oscillations, prompting the activation of recovery strategies. Ultimately, the attempt to reach waypoint 2 failed.
