Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task. The logs indicate that a new obstacle was detected at the position (-3.0, -0.5), which led to several issues:

1. **New Obstacle Detection**: "New obstacle detected at position (-3.0, -0.5)" confirms the presence of an obstacle.
2. **Replanning Efforts**: The robot's path was replanned multiple times in response to the detected obstacle.
3. **Trajectory Issues**: The log "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..." indicates the trajectory could not be followed due to the obstacle.
4. **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot attempted recovery behaviors like rotating, as indicated by "Rotate recovery behavior started," in an effort to navigate around the obstacle.

Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to create a valid plan to reach the waypoint and aborted the navigation task, as noted in the final logs: "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors" and "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
