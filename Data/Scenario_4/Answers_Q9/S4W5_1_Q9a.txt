Yes, an obstacle was encountered during the navigation task while the robot was attempting to reach waypoint 5 at coordinates (1.0, -6.0). The log messages indicate that a new obstacle was detected at this position, which prompted the robot to replan its path multiple times. Despite these efforts, the trajectory was deemed not feasible, and a recovery strategy was activated. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach waypoint 5.
