Yes, there were multiple obstacles encountered during the navigation task. The logs indicate several instances where the robot had to replan its path due to nearing obstacles:

1. "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
2. "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."

Additionally, there was a possible oscillation detected which led to the activation of a recovery strategy:

3. "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)."

Despite these attempts to replan and recover, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1.
