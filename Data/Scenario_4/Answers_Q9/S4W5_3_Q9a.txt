Yes, obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that a new obstacle was detected at position (3.0, 0.0) multiple times:
- After sending the goal to waypoint 2
- After sending the goal to waypoint 3
- After sending the goal to waypoint 4
- After sending the goal to waypoint 5

Additionally, when navigating towards waypoint 5, the log indicates that the robot was nearing the obstacle and the path had to be replanned, ultimately resulting in a failure to reach waypoint 5.
