Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task to waypoint 2. Specifically, the log messages indicate:

1. **New obstacle detected at position (1.5, -2.5)**: This log message confirms the detection of an obstacle at the specified coordinates.
   
2. **Path is being replanned**: This is a direct consequence of the obstacle being detected, indicating that the robot's path was adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

3. **TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected**: This message suggests difficulties in planning around the obstacle, leading to the activation of a recovery strategy.

4. **Failed to get a plan**: Indicating that the path replanning was initially unsuccessful.

5. **TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...**: Further difficulties in finding a feasible path were encountered, necessitating a reset of the planner.

6. **Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m)**: This represents an effort to clear the planning maps to better understand the surroundings and find a new path.

Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately **failed to reach waypoint 2** due to these obstacles.
