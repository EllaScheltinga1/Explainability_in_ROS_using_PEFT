Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task. Here are the details:

1. **During Navigation to Waypoint 1**:
   - A new obstacle was detected at position (3.0, -7.0). Despite this, the robot successfully reached waypoint 1.

2. **During Navigation to Waypoint 2**:
   - The same obstacle at position (3.0, -7.0) was detected again.
   - The robot attempted multiple times to replan its path around the obstacle but failed each time.
   - The planner (TebLocalPlannerROS) reported that the trajectory was not feasible, prompting a reset of the planner.
   - The costmaps were cleared, but the robot still failed to reach waypoint 2 due to the obstacle.
