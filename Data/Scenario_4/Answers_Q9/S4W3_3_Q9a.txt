Yes, the robot encountered several obstacles during its navigation task. Here are the details:

1. **Waypoint 1:** 
   - An obstacle was detected at position (-2.5, -12.0), but the robot successfully navigated around it and reached its goal.

2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - The same obstacle at position (-2.5, -12.0) was detected again, but the robot successfully navigated around it and reached its goal.

3. **Waypoint 3:**
   - The robot repeatedly encountered an obstacle that it couldn't navigate around. This triggered multiple replanning attempts and recovery behaviors, but it ultimately failed to find a valid path and aborted the mission. The log specifically mentions failed path planning and clearing costmaps, which are indications that the robot was unable to avoid the obstacle.
