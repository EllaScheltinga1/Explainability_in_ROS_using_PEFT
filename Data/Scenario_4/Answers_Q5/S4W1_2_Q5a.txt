The robot did not successfully reach the first waypoint. According to the log messages, the robot encountered obstacles and was unable to generate a valid plan to navigate past them, even after executing recovery behaviors. This resulted in the goal being aborted and the robot transitioning to the DONE state without reaching waypoint 1.
