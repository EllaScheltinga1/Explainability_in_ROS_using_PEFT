Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot did not successfully reach the first waypoint. The message "Failed to reach waypoint 1" indicates that the robot was unable to reach the planned destination at coordinates x=-2.0, y=-8.0 due to new obstacles detected at position (1.5, -3.0), which necessitated path replanning but ultimately resulted in failure. Therefore, the robot did not reach the first waypoint.
