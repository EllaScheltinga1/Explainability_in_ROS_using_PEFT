No, not all waypoints were successfully reached. The robot failed to reach waypoint 1 due to encountering an obstacle and subsequent planning issues. However, the robot successfully reached waypoints 2 and 3 as indicated by the log messages showing the transitions through ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE states, culminating in the confirmation "Reached waypoint 2" and "Reached waypoint 3."
