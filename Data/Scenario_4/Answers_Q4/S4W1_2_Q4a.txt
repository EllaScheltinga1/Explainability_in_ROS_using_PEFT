No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. Specifically, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. The logs indicate a series of failed planning attempts due to an obstacle and ultimately an aborted mission:

1. "Failed to get a plan."
2. "New obstacle detected at position (-3.0, -0.5)"
3. "Failed to get a plan."
4. "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
5. "Failed to get a plan."
6. "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
7. "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

These entries make it clear that the robot encountered difficulties in navigation and could not reach the intended waypoint.
