No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The first waypoint (x=1.0, y=-2.0) was successfully reached, as indicated by the log message "GOAL Reached!" and the transition to "DONE." However, the robot failed to reach the second waypoint (x=3.0, y=-7.0). Multiple attempts to replan the path were made due to the detection of an obstacle, but these attempts were unsuccessful, as shown by repeated "Failed to get a plan" messages and the final "Failed to reach waypoint 2" message.
