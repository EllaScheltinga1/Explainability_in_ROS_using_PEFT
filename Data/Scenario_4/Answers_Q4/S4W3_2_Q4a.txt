No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. 

Based on the ROS log messages:

- **Waypoint 1** (x=3.5, y=-7.0) was successfully navigated to and reached. This is indicated by the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 1."
- **Waypoint 2** (x=1.0, y=-11.0) was not reached. The robot encountered path planning issues due to obstacles and the message "Failed to reach waypoint 2" confirms it.
- **Waypoint 3** (x=4.0, y=-12.0) also was not reached. Similar issues with the trajectory and obstacles occurred, and the message "Failed to reach waypoint 3" confirms this as well. 

Conclusively, only waypoint 1 was successfully reached while waypoints 2 and 3 were not.
