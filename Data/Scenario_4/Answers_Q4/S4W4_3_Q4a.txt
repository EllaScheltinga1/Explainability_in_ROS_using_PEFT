No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. According to the log messages:

1. **Waypoint 1** at coordinates \( x = -3.5, y = -0.5 \) was successfully reached.
2. **Waypoint 2** at coordinates \( x = 1.0, y = 0.0 \) was successfully reached.
3. **Waypoint 3** at coordinates \( x = 3.0, y = -4.5 \) was not successfully reached. The robot encountered oscillation issues and obstacles that led to a failed attempt.
4. **Waypoint 4** at coordinates \( x = 3.0, y = 0.0 \) was successfully reached despite some replanning due to obstacles. 

So, three out of the four waypoints were successfully reached.
