No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. According to the ROS log messages, the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, and 3. However, when attempting to navigate to waypoint 4, the robot encountered an obstacle at position (-4.0, -9.0) and repeatedly failed to replan its path. Ultimately, the system failed to reach waypoint 4. The specific messages indicating this are:

1. "Failed to reach waypoint 4\."
2. "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
3. "Failed to get a plan."
4. Multiple instances of "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."

Therefore, the robot did not successfully reach waypoint 4.
