No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log indicates that the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. This conclusion is supported by multiple log entries where the TebLocalPlannerROS reported issues such as the trajectory being not feasible and possible oscillations. Despite attempts to replan the path and activate a recovery strategy, the robot ultimately did not reach the specified waypoint.
