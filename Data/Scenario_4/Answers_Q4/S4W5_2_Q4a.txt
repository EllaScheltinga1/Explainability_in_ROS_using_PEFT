The robot received a total of five waypoints to navigate to. The log entries indicate the outcomes for each waypoint as follows:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-4.0, y=-0.5)**: Reached successfully.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-2.5, y=0.0)**: Reached successfully.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-1.0, y=-1.0)**: Reached successfully.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=2.0, y=-7.0)**: Failed to reach due to repeated obstacle detection and planning failures.
5. **Waypoint 5 (x=2.0, y=-0.5)**: Reached successfully.

Therefore, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot failed to reach waypoint 4.
