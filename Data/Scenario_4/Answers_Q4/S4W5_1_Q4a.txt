No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot successfully reached waypoints 1 through 4, as indicated by the "GOAL Reached!" messages for each of those waypoints. However, the robot failed to reach waypoint 5 due to detection of a new obstacle and subsequent replanning and recovery attempts. The final log entry explicitly states "Failed to reach waypoint 5."
