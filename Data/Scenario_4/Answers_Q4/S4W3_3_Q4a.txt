No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. 

The robot successfully reached waypoint 1 and waypoint 2, as indicated by the logs:
- "Reached waypoint 1"
- "Reached waypoint 2"

However, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3. Despite several attempts to replan the path due to detected obstacles and executing all recovery behaviors, the planning ultimately failed:
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
- "Failed to reach waypoint 3"
