Based on the provided ROS log messages, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log shows that the robot received a waypoint with coordinates \( x=-2.0, y=-8.0 \), and it started navigating towards this waypoint. However, new obstacles were detected at position \( (1.5, -3.0) \) during the navigation, leading to multiple path replanning attempts. Ultimately, the log concludes with the message "Failed to reach waypoint 1", indicating that this waypoint was not successfully reached.
