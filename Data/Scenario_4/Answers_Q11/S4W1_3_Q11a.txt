The log messages do not provide specific coordinates or precise location details about where the obstacle is located. However, they indicate that the robot continually encounters obstacles during its attempt to navigate to waypoint 1 and replanning is repeatedly necessary. The consistent triggering of the TebLocalPlannerROS with messages like "trajectory is not feasible" and the need to clear both costmaps suggest that obstacles are present within the vicinity of the robot along its intended path toward the goal coordinates at x=3.0, y=1.0. The phrase "nearing the obstacle" implies that the obstacles are close enough to the robot's current position to impede its progress, but the exact location is not specified in the logs.
