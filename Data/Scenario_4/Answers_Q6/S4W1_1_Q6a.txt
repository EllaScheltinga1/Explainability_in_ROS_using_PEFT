The log messages do not indicate that the robot successfully reached any waypoint. The robot failed to reach waypoint 1 after multiple path replanning attempts due to an obstacle detected at position (1.5, -3.0). Therefore, the last known waypoint was the starting position, as the robot did not successfully navigate to any new waypoint.
