The last waypoint the robot successfully reached was waypoint 2, located at coordinates x=-3.0, y=-9.0. This is evident from the transition to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-2-34.416) and the statement "Reached waypoint 2" in the log. Subsequent attempts to reach waypoint 3 were unsuccessful due to navigation issues and obstacle avoidance challenges.
