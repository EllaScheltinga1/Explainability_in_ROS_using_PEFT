Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2. The log indicates that the robot detected a new obstacle at the position (3.0, -7.0), leading to several attempts to replan the path. Despite multiple attempts to replan, the log messages showed repeated failures to get a plan and, eventually, the trajectory was deemed not feasible, resulting in the conclusion that the robot failed to reach waypoint 2.
