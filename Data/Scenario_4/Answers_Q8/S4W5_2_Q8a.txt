Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 4. The logs indicate that while navigating to waypoint 4 at coordinates (x=2.0, y=-7.0), the robot detected several obstacles, attempted multiple replanning efforts, and encountered a planning failure. Finally, the `TebLocalPlannerROS` reported that the trajectory was not feasible, leading to a clearing of costmaps, and the robot still failed to reach the waypoint. This is explicitly mentioned in the log entry: 

"Failed to reach waypoint 4".
