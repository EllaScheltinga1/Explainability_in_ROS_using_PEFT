Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2. According to the log messages, after sending the goal to move_base for the coordinates \(x=-4.0, y=-4.5\), the robot encountered obstacles and several issues that prevented it from successfully navigating to this waypoint. Specific messages such as "New obstacle detected at position (-3.0, -5.0)", "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible", and "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected" indicate the robot struggled to find a feasible path and implement a recovery strategy, ultimately leading to the failure to reach waypoint 2.
