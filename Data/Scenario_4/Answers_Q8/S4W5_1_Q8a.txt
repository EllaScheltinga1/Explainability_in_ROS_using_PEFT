Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 5. The log messages indicate that a new obstacle was detected at position (1.0, -6.0), which led to multiple attempts to replan the path. Despite these attempts, including trajectory resetting and activating a recovery strategy, the robot ultimately did not reach waypoint 5 due to the persistent obstacle.
