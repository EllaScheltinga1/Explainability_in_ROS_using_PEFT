The log messages indicate that the robot detected new obstacles at position (1.5, -3.0) while navigating to waypoint 1 (x=-2.0, y=-8.0). As these obstacles were detected, the robot's path was being replanned to avoid collisions. Despite these replanning attempts, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. This suggests that the newly identified obstacles obstructed all feasible paths to the destination, preventing the robot from successfully navigating to the waypoint.
