The log messages indicate that the robot encountered difficulties in navigating to waypoint 2 primarily due to the presence of an obstacle and subsequent planning issues:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: A new obstacle was detected at position (1.5, -2.5). This necessitated a replanning of the path to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Oscillation**: The log mentions "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected." Oscillation indicates that the robot was potentially experiencing rapid back-and-forth movements or instability in its planned path, which can lead to the loss of a clear path to the goal.

3. **Path Replanning Failures**: Despite attempts to replan the path, the robot failed to generate a feasible plan multiple times ("Failed to get a plan").

4. **Trajectory Not Feasible**: The message "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..." suggests that the computed trajectories were not executable, possibly due to dynamic constraints, obstacles, or environmental factors.

5. **Costmap Clearance and Recovery Issues**: When the planner encountered issues, an attempt was made to clear the costmaps, which are used for obstacle representation in the robot's environment, to help with recovery. However, this did not resolve the issue.

6. **Recovery Strategy Activation**: The system activated a recovery strategy as indicated by "Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)" but still failed to generate a valid path.

Overall, the paths were not feasible due to the combination of obstacle presence, planning instabilities, and failure of the recovery strategies to generate executable trajectories.
