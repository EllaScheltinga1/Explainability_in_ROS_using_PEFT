The primary reason one or more paths were not feasible was the repeated detection of a new obstacle at the same position (3.0, 0.0). Here are the relevant details from the log messages:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: 
   - A new obstacle was detected multiple times at position (3.0, 0.0).
   - Specifically during the navigation to waypoints 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2. **Replanning and Failure**:
   - For waypoint 5, the log explicitly mentions that the robot is nearing the obstacle and that path replanning was attempted.
   - Despite the replanning effort, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 5.

In summary, the presence of an obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0) obstructed the robot's planned path, leading to infeasibility in reaching some waypoints and ultimately causing a failure to reach waypoint 5.
