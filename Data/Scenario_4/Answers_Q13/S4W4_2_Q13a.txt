One or more paths were deemed not feasible by the `TebLocalPlannerROS` due to detected obstacles and resulting oscillations. Below are detailed explanations based on the ROS log messages:

1. **New Obstacle Detection**:
   - Log: "New obstacle detected at position (-4.0, 0.0)"
   - Explanation: The robot detected a new obstacle at a specific position. This likely required the path to be replanned for safe navigation.

2. **Path Replanning**:
   - Log: "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
   - Explanation: As the robot approached the detected obstacle, the navigation system initiated a path replanning process to find an alternative route.

3. **Trajectory Infeasibility**:
   - Log: "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
   - Explanation: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected that the planned trajectory was not feasible, possibly due to the inability to navigate around the obstacle within dynamic constraints. This necessitated resetting the path planner.

4. **Oscillation Detection and Recovery**:
   - Log: "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)."
   - Explanation: The system detected oscillation, which indicates repeated failed attempts to navigate past an obstacle or difficulty in maintaining a stable path. In response, a recovery strategy was activated to favor the current turning direction during optimization in an attempt to stabilize the navigation process.

5. **Continued Infeasibility of Trajectories**:
   - Log: "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
   - Explanation: Despite the recovery efforts, the planner again found the trajectory infeasible. This repeated infeasibility suggests that the obstacles or the environment posed significant challenges to path planning.

6. **Failure to Reach Waypoint 2**:
   - Log: "Failed to reach waypoint 2."
   - Explanation: All efforts to replan the path to waypoint 2 failed, likely because of the persistent obstacles and possibly due to complex or dynamically changing environments.

In summary, the infeasibility of one or more paths was primarily due to the detection of new obstacles, resulting oscillations, and the inability of the path planner to find a feasible alternative route despite repeated attempts and recovery strategies.
