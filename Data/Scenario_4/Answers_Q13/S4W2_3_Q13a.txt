The paths were primarily not feasible due to the persistent presence of an obstacle at the target position (3.0, -7.0). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation based on the log entries:

1. **New Obstacle Detection**:
   - The log mentions a "New obstacle detected at position (3.0, -7.0)" twice. This indicates the presence of a significant obstruction at the target location.

2. **Path Replanning**:
   - The robot attempted to replan its path as it neared the obstacle, but these replanning efforts repeatedly failed. The log entries state: "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned. Failed to get a plan."

3. **Trajectory Feasibility Issue**:
   - The specific log entry "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..." indicates that the TebLocalPlannerROS, which is responsible for local trajectory planning, determined that the planned path was not viable given the current obstacle configuration.

4. **Costmap Clearing**:
   - The robot performed an action to clear its costmaps ("Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot"), yet subsequent entries indicate continued replanning failures, suggesting that the obstacle was consistently causing infeasibility in path planning decisions.

Given these points, the paths were not feasible due to the inability to plot a viable trajectory around the obstacle detected at the target location (3.0, -7.0). This led to multiple replanning attempts and failures, resulting in the robot ultimately failing to reach waypoint 2.
