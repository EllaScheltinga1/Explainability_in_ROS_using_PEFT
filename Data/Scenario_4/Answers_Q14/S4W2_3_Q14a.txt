The robot encountered multiple unfeasible paths when attempting to navigate to waypoint 2 (position x=3.0, y=-7.0). The process unfolded as follows:

1. **New Obstacle Detection**: The robot detected a new obstacle at position (3.0, -7.0).
2. **Path Replanning Attempts**: Upon nearing the obstacle, the robot attempted to replan its path several times. Each of these attempts failed, as indicated by the repeated log entries stating "Failed to get a plan."
3. **Trajectory Feasibility Check**: The local planner (`TebLocalPlannerROS`) determined that the trajectory was not feasible, prompting the need to reset the planner.
4. **Costmap Clearing**: The robot cleared both local and global costmaps outside a square area with a 3.00-meter side length centered on the robot. This action was likely intended to remove outdated or incorrect obstacle information that might have been causing planning errors.
5. **Continued Path Replanning Attempt**: Despite the costmap clearing and planner reset, the robot still faced difficulties and repeated attempts to replan the path ultimately failed.

Despite these strategies, the robot was unable to replan a feasible path to reach waypoint 2 and concluded with the log "Failed to reach waypoint 2."

In summary, the robot used multiple replanning attempts, trajectory feasibility checks, and costmap clearing, but these actions were ultimately unsuccessful in overcoming the obstacle and reaching the designated waypoint.
