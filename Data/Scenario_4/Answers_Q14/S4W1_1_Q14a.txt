The robot detected a new obstacle at position (1.5, -3.0) while navigating to waypoint 1, which rendered the original path unfeasible. The system triggered a path replanning process to handle the newly detected obstacle. Despite this effort, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1. This suggests that the replanned paths were either also unfeasible or that new obstacles or other issues prevented successful navigation.
