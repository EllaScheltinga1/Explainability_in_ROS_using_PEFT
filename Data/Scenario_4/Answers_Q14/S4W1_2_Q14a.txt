The robot employed a series of actions to handle unfeasible paths:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: It detected a new obstacle at position \((-3.0, -0.5)\).
2. **Replanning**: Upon identifying the obstacle, it attempted to replan the path but failed to generate a successful plan.
3. **Trajectory Feasibility Check**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` identified that the trajectory was not feasible, prompting a reset of the planner.
4. **Costmap Clearing**: In response to unfeasible paths, the robot cleared both costmaps around it to try and generate a new plan. This included clearing areas within a 3.00m and then a 1.50m square centered on the robot.
5. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: The robot initiated a rotate recovery behavior to attempt to either find a new path or reorient itself.
6. **Replanning Attempts**: The robot continuously tried to replan its path when nearing the obstacle but eventually failed each time.

Ultimately, after multiple replanning attempts and executing all available recovery behaviors without success, the robot aborted the goal and transitioned to a state where it acknowledged the plan could not be found and completed the sequence in the "DONE" state, marking the waypoint as failed to reach.
