The robot encountered an obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0) multiple times during its navigation tasks. When it detected this obstacle, it attempted to replan its path to avoid the obstruction. However, during the navigation towards waypoint 5, the robot identified that it was nearing the obstacle and triggered a path replanning. Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 5, indicating that the replanned path was not feasible in this instance. This suggests that the robot's routine for dealing with unfeasible paths involved obstacle detection and dynamic path replanning, though in some scenarios, the robot might still fail to successfully navigate to the goal if a viable path cannot be found.
