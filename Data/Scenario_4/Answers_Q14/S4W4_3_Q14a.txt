Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot employed several strategies to handle unfeasible paths, particularly when it detected obstacles or faced possible oscillations:

1. **Path Replanning**: The logs frequently mention that the robot was "nearing the obstacle" and as a response, "Path is being replanned." This indicates that the robot dynamically adjusts its path to navigate around obstacles when they are detected in its current route.

2. **Oscillation Recovery Strategies**: Logs such as "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected... Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)" indicate that the robot detected oscillations (repeated back-and-forth motions) during its navigation. To counter this, it activated a recovery strategy that likely increases stability by preferring a consistent turning direction.

3. **Clearing Costmaps**: The log entries "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot" and the similar one for a 1.50m square indicate that the robot cleared the local costmaps (which represent obstacles and free space around the robot) to re-evaluate the environment and obtain a more accurate view for path planning.

4. **Recovery Strategy for Oscillation Expiration**: The entry "TebLocalPlannerROS: oscillation recovery disabled/expired" suggests that the robot has a mechanism to disable certain recovery strategies if they are no longer effective or necessary.

These strategies combined allowed the robot to manage unfeasible paths by attempting different corrective actions, such as dynamically replanning the path, applying recovery behaviors to stabilize navigation, and ensuring a more accurate environmental perception by clearing and updating its costmaps.
