The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to a series of waypoints. These waypoints are defined by specific coordinates provided to the `move_base` action server. The log messages indicate that the robot navigated sequentially to each waypoint, experiencing various states and handling obstacles during its journey. Here is a summary of the robot's tasks:

1. **Navigate to Waypoint 1**: Coordinates (x=1.5, y=0.0). The robot successfully reached this waypoint.
   
2. **Navigate to Waypoint 2**: Coordinates (x=-4.0, y=1.0). The robot encountered an obstacle and was unable to reach this waypoint despite replanning its path.
   
3. **Navigate to Waypoint 3**: Coordinates (x=1.0, y=-4.5). After replanning to avoid obstacles, the robot successfully reached this waypoint.

4. **Navigate to Waypoint 4**: Coordinates (x=1.0, y=-11.0). The robot successfully reached this waypoint without issues.

Throughout these tasks, the robot's controllers, sensors, and planners were activated and utilized to achieve autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, and path replanning.
