The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to a specific waypoint with coordinates \( x = 3.0 \) and \( y = 1.0 \). This is indicated by the log entry "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x = 3.0, y = 1.0" and the message "Navigating to waypoint 1...". The robot attempted to reach this navigation goal but encountered several obstacles and replanning issues, ultimately resulting in the failure to reach the designated waypoint.
