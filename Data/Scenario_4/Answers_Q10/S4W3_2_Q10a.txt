The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to specified waypoints. The log details the robot's attempts to navigate to three different waypoints, specifying exact coordinates for each goal:
1. Waypoint 1: x=3.5, y=-7.0
2. Waypoint 2: x=1.0, y=-11.0
3. Waypoint 3: x=4.0, y=-12.0

For each waypoint, the robot has to send a goal to the `move_base` action server, navigate towards the specified position, and handle any obstacles along its path. The logs capture this process, including instances of successful navigation, obstacle detection, path replanning, and recovery attempts due to trajectory infeasibility.
