The robot's task was to navigate through a series of waypoints using the ROS move_base action server. Specifically, it had to travel to the following predefined goals:

1. Waypoint 1 at coordinates (x=-1.5, y=-5.5)
2. Waypoint 2 at coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-9.0)
3. Waypoint 3 at coordinates (x=-2.0, y=-12.0)

For each waypoint, the robot set a goal with move_base and attempted to navigate to the specified coordinates. The robot successfully reached the first two waypoints, but encountered obstacles and failed to reach the third waypoint despite several attempts at path replanning and recovery behaviors.
