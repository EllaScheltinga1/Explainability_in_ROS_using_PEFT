The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation. The robot received a sequence of navigation goals (waypoints) to reach specific coordinates in its environment. The log messages indicate that the robot was navigating to these waypoints using the `move_base` action server, handling obstacles, and transitioning through various states as it attempted to reach each goal:

1. **Waypoint 1**: (x=1.0, y=-12.0)
2. **Waypoint 2**: (x=1.0, y=-8.0)
3. **Waypoint 3**: (x=3.0, y=-7.0)
4. **Waypoint 4**: (x=0.5, y=-5.0)
5. **Waypoint 5**: (x=3.0, y=1.0)

The log messages show the robot successfully navigated the first four waypoints. At the fifth waypoint, after detecting an obstacle at (3.0, 0.0) and attempting to replan its path, the robot failed to reach the goal.
