The robot was tasked with autonomously navigating through a series of waypoints, which are specific coordinates defined by their \(x\) and \(y\) values. The provided ROS logs showcase the robot's journey as it attempts to reach these waypoints in sequence:

1. **Waypoint 1**: \(x = -1.0, y = 1.0\)
2. **Waypoint 2**: \(x = -4.0, y = -1.0\)
3. **Waypoint 3**: \(x = -2.0, y = 0.0\)
4. **Waypoint 4**: \(x = 2.0, y = -2.0\)
5. **Waypoint 5**: \(x = 1.0, y = -6.0\)

The logs denote the starting and transitioning states of the robot's navigation for each goal. The robot successfully reached the first four waypoints. However, it encountered an obstacle while navigating to the fifth waypoint, which prompted it to replan its path multiple times using different recovery strategies. Despite these efforts, the robot failed to reach the final waypoint.
