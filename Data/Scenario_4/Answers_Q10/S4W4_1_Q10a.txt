The robot had to perform an autonomous navigation task. It was given a series of waypoints to reach in sequence. Specifically, the robot was instructed to navigate to four different goal coordinates:

1. Waypoint 1: x=1.0, y=-2.0
2. Waypoint 2: x=0.0, y=-5.0
3. Waypoint 3: x=-3.0, y=-5.5
4. Waypoint 4: x=-4.0, y=-9.0

The robot successfully navigated to the first three waypoints but encountered persistent obstacles and path planning failures when attempting to reach the fourth waypoint, ultimately failing to reach it.
