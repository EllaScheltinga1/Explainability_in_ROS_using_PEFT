The robot demonstrated a consistent protocol when responding to the detected obstacle:

1. **Navigation Adjustments**:
    - **Waypoint 1**: Upon detecting a new obstacle at position (1.5, -3.0), the robot successfully navigated to and reached the goal.
    - **Waypoint 3**: Again, the same obstacle was detected, but the robot successfully reached the goal.

2. **Path Replanning Attempts**:
    - **Waypoint 4**: The obstacle continued to be at position (1.5, -3.0). The robot tried to replan the path multiple times when nearing the obstacle. This included several attempts to get a new plan which failed and triggering a planner reset due to a trajectory feasibility issue. The costmaps were cleared to enhance planning flexibility. Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach Waypoint 4.

3. **Modified Behavior**:
    - **Waypoint 5**: Despite the same obstacle, the robot was able to navigate and reach the goal. It performed a successful path replan when nearing the obstacle, indicating improved handling at this stage.

In summary, the robot predominantly attempted to replan its path when encountering the obstacle. Its success varied, as it failed to overcome the obstacle at Waypoint 4 but successfully navigated past it on other occasions.
