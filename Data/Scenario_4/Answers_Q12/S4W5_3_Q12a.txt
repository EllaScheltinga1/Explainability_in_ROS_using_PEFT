From the logs, we can see that the robot detected a new obstacle multiple times at the position (3.0, 0.0) during its navigation:

1. **Waypoint 2:** 
   - Detected a new obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0).
   - Successfully reached the goal and proceeded to transition states indicating successful completion.

2. **Waypoint 3:** 
   - Detected a new obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0).
   - Successfully reached the goal and proceeded to transition states indicating successful completion.

3. **Waypoint 4:** 
   - Detected a new obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0).
   - Successfully reached the goal and proceeded to transition states indicating successful completion.

4. **Waypoint 5:** 
   - Detected a new obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0).
   - A response indicating the robot was nearing the obstacle and its path being replanned was logged.
   - Ultimately, it failed to reach waypoint 5.

The logs specifically for the attempted navigation to waypoint 5 show that the robot responded to the detected obstacle by:
   - Notifying that the robot was nearing the obstacle.
   - Initiating a path replan to avoid the obstacle.
   - Despite these measures, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 5, suggesting that the replanned path might not have been viable or the obstacle could not be bypassed effectively.

In summary, the robot consistently detected the obstacle and took steps to replan its path when nearing the obstacle. However, the replanning efforts were insufficient to successfully navigate to waypoint 5.
