The robot's response to the detected obstacle can be broken down into several clear actions based on the log messages:

1. **New Obstacle Detection:** 
   - The robot detected a new obstacle at position (-2.5, -12.0).

2. **Path Replanning:**
   - As the robot neared the obstacle, it attempted to replan its path multiple times but failed each time ("Failed to get a plan.").

3. **Costmap Clearing:**
   - The robot attempted to clear both local and global costmaps to remove potential obstacles or dynamic changes.in steps: first, outside a 3.00m square, and later, a 1.50m square centered on the robot.

4. **Recovery Behaviors:**
   - The robot executed several recovery behaviors to adjust its path:
       - It started a "Rotate recovery behavior" to try to find a new clear path.

5. **Repeated Failures:**
   - Despite these attempts, the robot consistently failed to generate a valid plan to navigate around the obstacle.

6. **Abort Mission:**
   - After exhausting all recovery behaviors and path planning attempts, the robot aborted the mission because it could not establish a valid path to the goal.

7. **Mission State Transitions:**
   - The robot's mission state transitioned from ACTIVE to DONE via WAITING_FOR_RESULT, indicating the failed attempt to reach the third waypoint.

In summary, upon detecting the obstacle, the robot made several attempts to replan the path and employed recovery behaviors. However, it ultimately aborted the mission due to repeated failures in path planning.
