The robot responded to the detected obstacle by replanning its path. The log messages indicate that the robot detected a new obstacle at position (1.5, -3.0) and acknowledged it twice, which prompted the path replanning process each time. Despite the replanning efforts, the log ultimately notes that the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. This series of actions demonstrates that the robot's immediate response to the detected obstacle was to attempt to find an alternative route.
