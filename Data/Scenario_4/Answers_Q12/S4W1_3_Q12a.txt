The robot responded to the detected obstacle through a series of actions aimed at replanning its path and recovering from the issue:

1. **Path Replanning**: Upon nearing the obstacle, the log messages indicate that the robot's path was being replanned several times. Specifically, it states "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." This suggests that the robot's navigation system attempted to find an alternative trajectory to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Resetting the Planner**: The logs mentioned "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..." multiple times. This means that the current planned trajectory was determined to be infeasible by the TEB local planner, leading the system to reset the planning process and attempt to find a different path.

3. **Costmap Clearing**: The log "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot." indicates that the robot also tried to clear its environmental representations (costmaps) to possibly remove any erroneous obstacle information and aid in better replanning.

4. **Recovery Strategy Activation**: The log "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)." shows that the robot detected an oscillation, an undesirable repetitive motion, and therefore activated a recovery strategy to handle the situation.

Despite these attempts at replanning, resetting the planner, and clearing costmaps, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1, indicating that the obstacle or the path planning issues could not be fully resolved within the scope of the mentioned log messages.
