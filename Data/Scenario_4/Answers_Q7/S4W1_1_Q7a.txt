No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate that there were issues with obstacles detected at position (1.5, -3.0). The robot identified the obstacle, and paths were replanned multiple times. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1, indicating that despite the replanning efforts, a feasible path could not be found.
