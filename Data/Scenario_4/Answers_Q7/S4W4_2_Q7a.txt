No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the robot encountered issues while trying to reach waypoint 2. The log messages indicate that the robot detected a new obstacle at position (-4.0, 0.0) and attempted to replan its path multiple times. Despite these efforts, the trajectory was deemed not feasible by the TebLocalPlannerROS multiple times, and the waypoint 2 was not reached. For the other waypoints (1, 3, and 4), the robot successfully reached the goals without significant issues.
