No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. While the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, and 3, it encountered issues when navigating to waypoint 4. The log messages indicate that a new obstacle was detected at position (-4.0, -9.0) during the attempt to reach waypoint 4, and multiple attempts to replan the path were made.

The relevant log entries include:
- "New obstacle detected at position (-4.0, -9.0)"
- "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
- "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."

Despite several replanning attempts and costmap clearings, the robot failed to generate a feasible path to waypoint 4 and ultimately did not reach it.
