No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log indicates that the robot successfully reached waypoints 1 through 4. However, when it attempted to reach waypoint 5, a new obstacle was detected, and the log explicitly mentions, "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." This is followed by the statement, "Failed to reach waypoint 5." This indicates that the planned path to waypoint 5 was not feasible due to the obstacle, and the robot could not successfully navigate to that waypoint.
