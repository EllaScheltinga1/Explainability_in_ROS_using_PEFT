No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. According to the log messages, the robot initially navigated successfully to waypoint 1. However, when it attempted to navigate to waypoint 2, the system encountered multiple issues related to obstacles. Specifically, the following entries indicate the problem:

1. **New obstacle detected at position (3.0, -7.0)**: This message highlights an obstacle detected along the planned path.
2. **Failed to get a plan**: This message was logged multiple times, indicating the robotâ€™s inability to generate a feasible plan to navigate around the detected obstacle.
3. **TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...**: This indicates that the trajectory generated by the local planner was determined to be infeasible, prompting the planner to reset.
4. **Failed to reach waypoint 2**: This confirms that despite several attempts and replanning efforts, the robot failed to reach the second waypoint due to the infeasibility of the planned paths around the obstacle. 

Thus, it is clear that not all paths were feasible, particularly for the navigation attempt to waypoint 2.
