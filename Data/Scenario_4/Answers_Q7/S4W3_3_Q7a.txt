No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3 due to repeated issues in finding a valid plan when encountering an obstacle. This was despite attempts at path re-planning and executing recovery behaviors. Here is a summary of the key points from the log:

1. **Waypoint 1 and 2**:
    - Navigation to both waypoints 1 and 2 were successful.
    - The robot was able to plan and execute the path successfully, reaching both goals despite the detection of obstacles.

2. **Waypoint 3**:
    - The robot encountered a persistent issue while navigating to waypoint 3.
    - Logs indicate multiple instances where the robot was "nearing the obstacle" and attempts at re-planning the path failed.
    - Recovery behaviors, including costmap clearing and rotate recovery, were executed but did not resolve the issue.
    - Ultimately, the robot aborted the task because it could not find a valid plan even after executing all recovery behaviors.

Thus, only the paths to waypoints 1 and 2 were feasible, while the path to waypoint 3 was not.
