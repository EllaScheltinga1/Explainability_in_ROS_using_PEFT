No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. While the robot successfully reached waypoints 1 through 4, it encountered issues while navigating to waypoint 5. Specifically, a new obstacle was detected at position (1.0, -6.0), leading to repeated path replanning attempts and ultimately the trajectory being deemed not feasible. Additionally, attempts to recover from a possible oscillation and clear the costmaps did not resolve the issue, resulting in the failure to reach waypoint 5.
