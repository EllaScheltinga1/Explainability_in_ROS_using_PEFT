No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. While the robot successfully reached waypoint 1, there were issues when navigating to waypoint 2. Specifically, the logs indicate that the `TebLocalPlannerROS` declared the trajectory as "not feasible," necessitating multiple re-planning attempts. Furthermore, a potential oscillation was detected, prompting the activation of a recovery strategy. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2 due to these obstacles and feasibility issues.
