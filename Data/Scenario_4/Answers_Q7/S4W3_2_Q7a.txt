No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate several instances where the local planner, particularly the TebLocalPlannerROS, determined that the planned trajectories were not feasible. This issue occurred multiple times, resulting in path replanning and occasional activation of recovery strategies. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach both waypoint 2 and waypoint 3 due to these infeasibility issues.
