No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the path to waypoint 1 was problematic:

1. The robot detected a new obstacle at (1.5, -3.5).
2. It failed to get a plan multiple times due to the obstacle.
3. The **TebLocalPlannerROS** indicated that the trajectory was not feasible and had to reset the planner.
4. Costmaps were cleared in attempts to replan the path.
5. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1.

This indicates that the path planning to waypoint 1 was not feasible due to the newly detected obstacle. However, navigation to waypoints 2 and 3 was successful, indicating those paths were feasible.
