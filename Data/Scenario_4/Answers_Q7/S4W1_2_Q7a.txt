No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate multiple failures in planning and executing the navigation to waypoint 1. Specifically:

1. "Failed to get a plan." – Indicates an initial failure to generate a feasible plan.
2. "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." – Suggests that an obstacle was detected, necessitating re-planning.
3. "Failed to get a plan." (Repeated) – Indicates continued issues with generating a feasible plan.
4. "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..." – Explicitly states that a particular trajectory was deemed infeasible by the local planner, leading to a planner reset.
5. "Failed to get a plan." (Repeated) – Indicates persistent issues despite recovery attempts.
6. "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors." – Confirms that despite multiple attempts and recovery behaviors, a valid plan could not be established.

Ultimately, the task was aborted, and the log "Failed to reach waypoint 1" indicates that the robot could not navigate successfully to the designated waypoint.
