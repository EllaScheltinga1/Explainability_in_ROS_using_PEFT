No, not all of the planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, while navigating to waypoint 4 (x=2.0, y=-7.0), the robot encountered multiple planning issues:

1. The log messages indicate that the robot detected a new obstacle multiple times at position (1.5, -3.0).
2. The messages "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." were repeated, followed each time by "Failed to get a plan."
3. The planner had to be reset with "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible."
4. There was an attempt to clear the costmaps to generate a new plan: "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
5. Despite these efforts, it finally resulted in "Failed to reach waypoint 4" indicating that the path was ultimately not feasible.

This issue did not occur for other waypoints, as the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 5.
