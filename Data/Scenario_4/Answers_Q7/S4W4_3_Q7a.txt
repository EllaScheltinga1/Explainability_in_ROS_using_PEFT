No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically:

- The robot successfully navigated to waypoints 1, 2, and 4.
- However, it failed to reach waypoint 3. The log indicates multiple instances of re-planning and costmap clearing due to obstacles, but ultimately the robot could not reach waypoint 3 and had to skip it.

This indicates that the path to waypoint 3 was not feasible, likely due to persistent obstacles and difficulties in re-planning a viable path.
