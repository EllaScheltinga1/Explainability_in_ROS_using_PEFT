No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate multiple instances where the TebLocalPlannerROS determined that the trajectory was not feasible. Specifically, there were several messages indicating that the path needed to be replanned due to obstacles, and then subsequent messages stating "trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...". Additionally, there was a detection of possible oscillation which triggered a recovery strategy. Ultimately, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1.
