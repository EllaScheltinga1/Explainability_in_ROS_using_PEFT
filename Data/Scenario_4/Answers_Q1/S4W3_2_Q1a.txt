The robot received three waypoints based on the ROS log messages provided. The log mentions sending goal commands to `move_base` for three different waypoints:

1. The first waypoint: `Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=3.5, y=-7.0`
2. The second waypoint: `Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-11.0`
3. The third waypoint: `Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=4.0, y=-12.0`
