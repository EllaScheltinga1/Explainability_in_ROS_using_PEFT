The robot received a total of **three** waypoints. This is evident from the log messages where the robot sends goals to the `move_base` action server for each waypoint:

1. **Goal 1** to move_base: x=-1.5, y=-5.5
2. **Goal 2** to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-9.0
3. **Goal 3** to move_base: x=-2.0, y=-12.0

Each goal corresponds to a waypoint the robot aimed to navigate to.
