The reasons for the infeasibility of the paths can be inferred from the logs:\n\n1. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 2**:\n    - **Oscillation Detected**: The log indicates that a possible oscillation of the robot or its local plan was detected by `TebLocalPlannerROS`. Oscillation often implies that the robot is struggling to decide on a clear path or is repeatedly trying to move back and forth without making progress.\n    - **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot attempted recovery strategies, including clearing costmaps (removing obstacles and updating the map) and executing a rotate recovery behavior. However, these efforts were unsuccessful.\n    - **Aborting Due to Persistent Oscillation**: Ultimately, the robot aborted the attempt because it kept oscillating despite executing all recovery behaviors.\n\n2. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 3**:\n    - **Failed to Get a Plan**: The log explicitly states that the robot failed to get a valid navigation plan. This likely indicates that the global planner could not find a feasible path from the robot\u2019s current location to the waypoint, possibly due to obstacles, narrow passages, or unreachable areas.\n    - **Recovery Behaviors Again Unsuccessful**: Similar to Waypoint 2, the robot tried clearing costmaps and performing rotate recovery behavior but couldn\u2019t make any progress.\n    - **Aborting Due to Invalid Plan**: After multiple attempts, the system aborted the navigation effort as a valid plan could not be found even after executing recovery strategies.\n\nIn both failed cases, the infeasibility of the paths can be attributed to:\n- **Oscillations and Local Planning Failures**: The robot got stuck in a loop trying to resolve its local path, which prevented it from moving toward the goal smoothly.\n- **Inability to Generate a Valid Plan**: For Waypoint 3 specifically, the global planner was unable to find any feasible path, suggesting the area may be inaccessible or too complex for the robot to navigate given its current configuration and sensor data.\n\nIn contrast, the successful navigations (Waypoints 1, 4, and 5) did not encounter these issues, indicating relatively clear and navigable paths to those targets."}]}

Clearing the costmaps is typically a recovery behavior to eliminate potential obstacles from the map that might not exist or to deal with transient issues like sensor noise.\n\n3. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n   - Despite the costmaps being cleared, the robot still failed to generate a plan. The log mentions the initiation of a \"Rotate recovery behavior,\" which is another attempt to recover from planning failures by rotating the robot to scan for viable paths.\n\n4. **Final Plan Failure**:\n   - After executing all recovery behaviors, the log concludes with \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors\". This definitively shows that every attempt to find a valid path\u2014through replanning and recovery behaviors\u2014was unsuccessful.\n\n5. **Environmental Constraints**:\n   - The repeated failure to generate a plan and the eventual need to abort suggest there could be significant environmental constraints that the robot\u2019s sensors and algorithms deemed impassable. These could include obstacles, narrow passages, or other navigation hazards that the robot's system could not find a way around.\n\nIn summary, the paths were not feasible mainly due to the robot's inability to generate a valid plan, even after multiple attempts at recovery, likely due to insurmountable obstacles or challenging environment features in the robot's immediate vicinity."}]}

Clearing them helps in recalculating a potential new path by removing potentially outdated or erroneous data.\n\n3. **Recovery behaviors**: The robot executed a \"Rotate recovery behavior\" which is a common method to try and get unstuck by rotating to scan the environment for a feasible path.\n\n4. **Persistent failure**: Despite these recovery attempts, the robot again failed to generate a valid plan and eventually aborted the task.\n\n5. **Aborting due to no valid plan**: The repeated failures to generate a valid path and the unsuccessful execution of recovery behaviors led to the final decision to abort the planning attempt.\n\nIn summary, the reason for the infeasibility of the path to waypoint 3 was the navigation stack's inability to generate a valid path due to potential obstacles or other environmental factors, despite attempting costmap clearing and recovery behaviors."}]}

This happened multiple times during the attempt to reach waypoint 3 (\"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned\").\n\n3. **Oscillation and Recovery:**\n   - The `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected possible oscillation, which is often an indication of a planning or execution issue where the robot or its plan is oscillating back and forth instead of making progress. The planner then activated a recovery strategy (\"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected. Activating recovery strategy\").\n\n4. **Costmap Clearing:**\n   - The robot performed multiple costmap clearing operations to remove obstacles from its navigation map. This was evident from the messages \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot\" and \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot\". Frequent need for costmap clearing indicates persistent or intermittent obstacles impacting the feasibility of the paths.\n\n5. **Failure to Reach Waypoint:**\n   - Despite replanning and costmap clearing, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 3, as indicated by the message \"Failed to reach waypoint 3\". This failure highlights that the obstacles and the resulting replanning were significant enough to prevent successful navigation to the target waypoint.\n\nOverall, the primary reason for the infeasibility of one or more paths was the presence of obstacles that complicated the navigation process, leading to repeated replanning and recovery actions that were insufficient to ensure path viability."}]}

Consequently, the planner activated a recovery strategy that prioritized the current turning direction during optimization in an attempt to stabilize and find a feasible path.\n\n3. **Failed Plans**: Despite the replanning efforts, the robot failed to obtain a new viable path multiple times, as indicated by the repeated failures to get a plan.\n\n4. **Trajectory Infeasibility and Resetting Planner**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` declared the trajectory not feasible. Consequently, the planner was reset to potentially clear previous states and approaches that led to failure.\n\n5. **Clearing Costmaps**: As a resourceful strategy, the robot cleared both local and global costmaps (used for obstacle avoidance and path planning) outside a 3.00m square centered on itself. This strategy effectively removes old or stale data about obstacles that might be leading the planner astray.\n\n6. **Disabling Oscillation Recovery**: Lastly, the planner noted that oscillation recovery was disabled or expired, indicating that the specific recovery mechanism had concluded or was no longer applicable.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 2, as it couldn't find a feasible trajectory. This indicates persistent challenges in the environment or limitations within the planner's current configuration."}]}

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues observed in the logs:\n\n1. **Goals Off the Global Costmap**:\n   - For goals 1, 3, and 4, the log explicitly states that the \"goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap,\" indicating that these positions are located outside the navigable area of the global costmap. As a result, any attempt to plan a path to these positions would inherently fail.\n\n2. **Planning Failure**:\n   - When the planner attempts to find a valid path to a waypoint that is off the costmap, it will always fail because the planner relies on the defined costmap boundaries to generate routes.\n\n3. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n   - Each time the planner failed to find a valid path, the system attempted various recovery behaviors, including clearing the costmaps and performing a rotate recovery maneuver. Despite these attempts, the paths remained unfeasible because the fundamental issue of the goals being outside the costmap's boundaries could not be overcome.\n\n4. **Failed Plans and Abortions**:\n   - Each failed attempt to generate a valid plan led to an automatic transition to aborting the navigation goal, and the system informed of its inability to reach the waypoint.\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of the paths is due to the waypoints being positioned outside the valid navigation area as defined by the global costmap. This parameter is crucial for the planner\u2019s functioning because it determines the accessible and non-accessible zones in the robot\u2019s operational environment. As a result, all recovery attempts were ineffective in resolving this fundamental mapping issue."}]}

Planning will always fail to this goal.\"\n   - This repeats twice, indicating that the global planner's constraints did not allow access to the specified goal's location.\n\n2. **Recovery Behaviors:**\n   - The system attempted several recovery measures, such as clearing costmaps and initiating rotate recovery behaviors, but these did not resolve the issue.\n   - \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\"\n   - \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot.\"\n   - \"Rotate recovery behavior started.\"\n\n3. **Failure to Plan:**\n   - Ultimately, all recovery efforts failed, leading to the aborting of the goal attempt.\n   - \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors.\"\n\nConclusively, the infeasibility arose because the specified waypoint was outside the operational boundaries of the planner\u2019s costmap, making it impossible for the planner to generate a valid path, despite multiple recovery attempts."}]}

Here's a detailed explanation of how it attempted to handle the situation:\n\n1. **Detection of an Unreachable Goal**: The log indicates that the goal sent to the global planner was outside the global costmap, which implies that the goal was beyond the boundaries that the planner could handle. This is a critical detail because the planner relies on the costmap to define navigable areas, and planning paths to locations outside this map will inherently fail.\n\n2. **Active Navigation Attempts**: Despite the unfeasible goal, the robot transitioned into the ACTIVE state from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, indicating that it initially attempted to navigate to the waypoint. This suggests that the system might have considered some possibilities before completely ruling out the goal.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**: Once it became apparent that the path was challenging, the robot engaged in recovery behaviors. It cleared both costmaps, which are data structures used to represent the environment, OBSTACLES, and free space around the robot, within varying sizes (first within a 3.00m square and then within a 1.50m square centered on the robot). This action could have been an attempt to refresh and eliminate any erroneous or outdated sensory data obstructing optimal path planning.\n\n4. **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot utilized a \"rotate recovery behavior,\" which typically involves rotating in place to find a viable path or clear obstacles within its immediate vicinity. This is a standard recovery behavior intended to help the robot get unstuck and potentially find alternative free paths.\n\n5. **Repeated Detection and Failure to Plan**: Even after undertaking the recovery procedures, the global planner repeatedly identified that the goal remained off the global costmap. Consequently, planning continued to fail.\n\n6. **Transition to DONE and Abortion**: After active attempts and recovery behaviors, the robot transitioned from ACTIVE to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and finally to DONE, concluding with a failure to reach the goal. The sequence was terminated when it aborted the mission for the waypoint, citing that no valid plan could be found despite all recovery efforts.\n\nIn summary, when faced with unfeasible paths, the robot attempted to refresh its environment understanding via costmap clearing and engaged in rotate recovery behavior to potentially re-evaluate the path. Despite these measures, if a path remains unfeasible due to being outside the global costmap, the robot aborts the navigation attempt to prevent further futile planning."}]}
