Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot successfully reached all specified waypoints. Here is the breakdown of the waypoints and their statuses:

1. **Waypoint 1:** 
   - Sent goal to move_base: `x=-4.0, y=-2.0`
   - Status: "GOAL Reached!"
   - Endpoint: "Reached waypoint 1"
   
2. **Waypoint 2:** 
   - Sent goal to move_base: `x=1.0, y=-2.5`
   - Status: Initially faced issues (trajectory not feasible, possible oscillation detected, recovery strategy activated), but eventually: "GOAL Reached!"
   - Endpoint: "Reached waypoint 2"
   
3. **Waypoint 3:** 
   - Sent goal to move_base: `x=1.0, y=-5.0`
   - Status: "GOAL Reached!"
   - Endpoint: "Reached waypoint 3"
   
4. **Waypoint 4:** 
   - Sent goal to move_base: `x=-3.0, y=-6.0`
   - Status: "GOAL Reached!"
   - Endpoint: "Reached waypoint 4"

Given these log details, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach.
