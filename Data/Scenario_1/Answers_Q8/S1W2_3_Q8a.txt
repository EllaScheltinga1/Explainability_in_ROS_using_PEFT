Based on the ROS log messages provided:

1. The robot navigated to waypoint 1 with coordinates \(x = 3.0\), \(y = -4.5\), and the logs indicate the following sequence:
    - "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=3.0, y=-4.5"
    - "Navigating to waypoint 1..."
    - "GOAL Reached!"
    - "Reached waypoint 1"

2. The robot then navigated to waypoint 2 with coordinates \(x = -2.0\), \(y = -5.5\), and the logs indicate the following sequence:
    - "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-2.0, y=-5.5"
    - "Navigating to waypoint 2..."
    - "GOAL Reached!"
    - "Reached waypoint 2"

At both waypoints, the robot's transition states showed it moved from ACTIVE to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and finally to DONE, indicating successful navigation and goal completion.

Therefore, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints, as there are no indications in the logs of any failures to reach a waypoint.
