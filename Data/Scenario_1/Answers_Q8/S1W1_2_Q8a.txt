Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication that the robot failed to reach any waypoint. The log specifically mentions a goal was sent to move the robot to waypoint 1 (`x=-3.5, y=-3.5`), and the robot successfully transitioned through the states of navigation:

1. **Transitioning to ACTIVE** - indicating the robot has begun moving towards the goal.
2. **Motion played successfully** - suggesting the movement was executed without issues.
3. **GOAL Reached!** - confirming that the robot reached the specified waypoint.
4. **Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT** 
5. **Transitioning to DONE** 

Finally, the log explicitly states "Reached waypoint 1." Thus, according to the logs, the robot successfully reached its designated waypoint without any failures.
