Based on the ROS log messages provided, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach. For each waypoint (1 through 5), the logs indicate:
- A goal sent to `move_base`,
- Navigation to the waypoint,
- Transition to ACTIVE state,
- Transition to WAITING_FOR_RESULT state,
- Transition to DONE state,
- And a confirmation that the waypoint was reached with "GOAL Reached!"

Each waypoint was successfully reached according to the log messages.
