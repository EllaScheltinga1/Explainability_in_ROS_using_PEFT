No, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints it attempted to navigate to. The log messages indicate that the robot reached both waypoint 1 (x=1.0, y=-4.5) and waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=-10.5). The sequence "GOAL Reached!" followed by "Transitioning to DONE" for both waypoints confirms successful navigation and completion.
