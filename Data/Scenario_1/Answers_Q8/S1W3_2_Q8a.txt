Based on the ROS log messages provided, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints. Here is the confirmation for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1**: 
   - Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.0, y=-6.5
   - GOAL Reached!
   - Reached waypoint 1

2. **Waypoint 2**: 
   - Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-2.0, y=-6.0
   - GOAL Reached!
   - Reached waypoint 2

3. **Waypoint 3**: 
   - Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-12.0
   - GOAL Reached!
   - Reached waypoint 3

Therefore, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach.
