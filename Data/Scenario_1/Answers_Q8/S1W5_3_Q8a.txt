No, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints it was assigned. The log messages indicate that for every goal sent to `move_base`, the robot navigated to the waypoint and the status transitioned to "GOAL Reached" followed by "DONE," confirming that each waypoint was successfully reached. These waypoints are:

1. Waypoint 1 at coordinates x=-3.5, y=0.0
2. Waypoint 2 at coordinates x=1.0, y=-3.0
3. Waypoint 3 at coordinates x=0.0, y=-4.0
4. Waypoint 4 at coordinates x=1.0, y=-12.0
5. Waypoint 5 at coordinates x=-4.0, y=-12.0
