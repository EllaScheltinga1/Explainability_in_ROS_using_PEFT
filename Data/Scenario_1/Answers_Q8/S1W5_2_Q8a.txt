Based on the log messages, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints that were set. Each goal transition includes the following steps:

1. Sending goal to `move_base` with specific coordinates.
2. Transitioning to ACTIVE.
3. A confirmation that the goal was reached.
4. Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
5. Transitioning to DONE.
6. Confirmation that the specific waypoint was reached.

This successful sequence is repeated for all waypoints from 1 to 5. Therefore, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach.
