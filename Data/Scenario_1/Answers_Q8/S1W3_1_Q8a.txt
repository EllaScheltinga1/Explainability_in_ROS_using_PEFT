No, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach. According to the log messages, the robot successfully navigated to each of the three waypoints specified:

1. Waypoint 1: x=-2.0, y=-1.0
    - "GOAL Reached!"
    - "Reached waypoint 1"

2. Waypoint 2: x=-4.0, y=-1.0
    - "GOAL Reached!"
    - "Reached waypoint 2"

3. Waypoint 3: x=2.0, y=-4.0
    - "GOAL Reached!"
    - "Reached waypoint 3"

The logs indicate successful transitions through the various states (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) for each waypoint, culminating in the confirmation that each goal was reached.
