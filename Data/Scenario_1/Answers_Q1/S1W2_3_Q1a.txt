The ROS log messages indicate that the robot received and navigated to two waypoints. The first waypoint is identified as "waypoint 1" with coordinates \(x=3.0, y=-4.5\), and the second waypoint is identified as "waypoint 2" with coordinates \(x=-2.0, y=-5.5\). 

Therefore, the total number of waypoints received is **two**.
