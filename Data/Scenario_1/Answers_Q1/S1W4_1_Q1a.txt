Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot received and navigated to four waypoints. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1**: x=-1.0, y=1.0
2. **Waypoint 2**: x=0.0, y=-3.5
3. **Waypoint 3**: x=2.0, y=-6.0
4. **Waypoint 4**: x=1.5, y=-11.5

Each waypoint has an associated goal sent to the `move_base` and a corresponding series of status transitions indicating successful reach of each waypoint.
