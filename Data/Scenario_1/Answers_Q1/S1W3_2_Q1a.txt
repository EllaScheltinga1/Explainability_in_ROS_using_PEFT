The log messages indicate that three waypoints were received during the robot's operation. This can be confirmed by the distinct "Sending goal" messages for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1:** 
   - Message: Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.0, y=-6.5

2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - Message: Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-2.0, y=-6.0

3. **Waypoint 3:**
   - Message: Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-12.0

Therefore, the robot received and processed three waypoints.
