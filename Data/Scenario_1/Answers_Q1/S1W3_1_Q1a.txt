The robot received three waypoints. This can be inferred from the log entries indicating the sending and successful navigation to three distinct waypoints with coordinates:
1. First waypoint: x=-2.0, y=-1.0
2. Second waypoint: x=-4.0, y=-1.0
3. Third waypoint: x=2.0, y=-4.0

Each waypoint was confirmed as reached through the "GOAL Reached!" and corresponding transitions to the DONE state.
