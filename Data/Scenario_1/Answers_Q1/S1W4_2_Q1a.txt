The ROS log messages indicate that the robot received and successfully navigated to four waypoints. Each waypoint corresponds to a "Sending goal" log entry followed by navigation status updates:

1. **Waypoint 1**: "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=-4.0, y=-2.0"
2. **Waypoint 2**: "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-2.5"
3. **Waypoint 3**: "Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-5.0"
4. **Waypoint 4**: "Sending goal 4 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-6.0"

Therefore, the total number of waypoints received is four.
