Based on the log messages provided, the robot received and navigated to **two** waypoints. This can be deduced from the records showing goals being sent to `move_base` for specific coordinates:
1. Goal 1: `x=1.0, y=-4.5`
2. Goal 2: `x=2.0, y=-10.5`

The log confirms that these two waypoints were reached successfully:
- "Reached waypoint 1"
- "Reached waypoint 2"
