The log messages indicate that the robot received and successfully navigated to 5 waypoints. These waypoints are:

1. Waypoint 1: \( x=1.0, y=-5.0 \)
2. Waypoint 2: \( x=-2.5, y=-5.5 \)
3. Waypoint 3: \( x=-4.0, y=-9.0 \)
4. Waypoint 4: \( x=1.0, y=-11.0 \)
5. Waypoint 5: \( x=2.0, y=-4.0 \)

This is evidenced by the repeated log pattern indicating the transition through the states \( WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK \), \( ACTIVE \), \( WAITING_FOR_RESULT \), and \( DONE \) for each goal, followed by the message "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint" with the corresponding waypoint number.
