Based on the ROS log messages provided, the task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to multiple waypoints. The robot executed the following sequence:

1. Initialization steps, like tucking the arm and starting various controllers (force_torque_sensor_controller, imu_sensor_controller, hand_controller, joint_state_controller, torso_controller, head_controller, arm_controller, mobile_base_controller).
2. It then connected to the `move_base` action server, which is typically responsible for path planning and moving the robot to a specified goal location.
3. It navigated sequentially to four specified waypoints with coordinates:
   - Waypoint 1: (x=0.0, y=0.0)
   - Waypoint 2: (x=-4.0, y=0.0)
   - Waypoint 3: (x=0.0, y=-4.0)
   - Waypoint 4: (x=-3.0, y=-6.0)

For each waypoint, the robot:
- Sent a navigation goal to `move_base`.
- Transitioned through different states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) indicating progress.
- Reported when it reached each waypoint successfully.

The task involved precise coordination and navigation across these predefined waypoints, ensuring the robot reached each specified location without issues.
