The task the robot had to perform was autonomously navigating to specified waypoints. According to the ROS log messages, the robot connected to the move_base action server and was given goal coordinates to reach (x=3.0, y=-4.5 for waypoint 1 and x=-2.0, y=-5.5 for waypoint 2). The robot successfully navigated to each waypoint, transitioning through various states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) and confirming that it reached each goal.
