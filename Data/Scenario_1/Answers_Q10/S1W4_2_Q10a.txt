The robot's task was to navigate sequentially through a series of waypoints. Here is the detailed breakdown of the task based on the log messages:

1. **Initial Setup**: The robot starts by tucking its arm and initializing various controllers including hand, joint state, torso, head, arm, mobile base, IMU sensor, and force torque sensor controllers.
2. **Connecting to Move Base**: The robot waits for and connects to the move_base action server, which is responsible for handling navigation goals.
3. **Waypoint Navigation**:
   - **Waypoint 1**: The robot is given a navigation goal at coordinates x=-4.0, y=-2.0. It successfully navigates to this location, transitioning through several states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) and confirms reaching the waypoint.
   - **Waypoint 2**: The robot receives a second goal at coordinates x=1.0, y=-2.5. During this navigation, there are messages indicating the TebLocalPlannerROS had trajectory feasibility issues and oscillation, which triggered recovery strategies. Despite these challenges, the robot reaches the second waypoint successfully.
   - **Waypoint 3**: The robot is given a third goal at coordinates x=1.0, y=-5.0, and navigates to this waypoint without reported issues.
   - **Waypoint 4**: The robot is finally tasked with reaching coordinates x=-3.0, y=-6.0. It navigates to this final waypoint successfully.

In summary, the robot's task was to sequentially navigate through four specified waypoints while handling potential navigation challenges along the way.
