Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot's task was to navigate to specific waypoints after initializing and tucking its arm. Here is a breakdown of the task sequence:

1. **Initialization and Arm Tuck**:
   - The robot started and successfully activated various controllers (`joint_state_controller`, `torso_controller`, `head_controller`, `arm_controller`, `mobile_base_controller`, `force_torque_sensor_controller`, `imu_sensor_controller`, and `hand_controller`).
   - The robot tucked its arm, indicating it was preparing for navigation by ensuring the arm was in a safe position.

2. **Navigation to Waypoints**:
   - The robot established a connection with the `move_base` action server, which is used for navigation tasks.
   - **First Waypoint**:
     - A goal was sent to `move_base` with coordinates \( (x = 1.0, y = -4.5) \).
     - The robot transitioned through various states (WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) as it navigated and successfully reached the first waypoint.
   - **Second Waypoint**:
     - A subsequent goal was sent to `move_base` with coordinates \( (x = 2.0, y = -10.5) \).
     - Similar state transitions were observed as the robot navigated to and reached the second waypoint successfully.

Therefore, the robot's task was to navigate to the specified waypoints (with coordinates \( (1.0, -4.5) \) and \( (2.0, -10.5) \)) after initializing its systems and preparing its arm for safe movement.
