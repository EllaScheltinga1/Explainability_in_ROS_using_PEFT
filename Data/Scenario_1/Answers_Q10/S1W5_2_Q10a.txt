The robot's task was to navigate through a sequence of waypoints. The log messages show that the robot successfully transitioned through various states (WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) for each navigation goal. The robot was assigned a series of goals, each with specific x and y coordinates, and it successfully reached each waypoint. The progression of goals and successful completions indicates the task was likely a navigation exercise, potentially testing the robot's autonomous navigation capabilities.
