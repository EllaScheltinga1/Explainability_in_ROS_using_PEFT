The task the robot had to perform is autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. The log messages indicate that the robot was commanded to navigate to three separate coordinates (waypoints) sequentially:

1. Waypoint 1: Coordinates (x=2.0, y=-6.5)
2. Waypoint 2: Coordinates (x=-2.0, y=-6.0)
3. Waypoint 3: Coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-12.0)

For each waypoint, the robot connected to the `move_base` action server, sent a goal, and successfully navigated to the specified coordinates, transitioning through various states such as ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE, before reaching each waypoint.
