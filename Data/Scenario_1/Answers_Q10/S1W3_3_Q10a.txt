The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to a series of waypoints. The log indicates that the robot was sequentially sent to three different goals, identified by coordinates:

1. Waypoint 1: x=3.0, y=-4.0
2. Waypoint 2: x=2.5, y=-6.5
3. Waypoint 3: x=2.0, y=-11.0

For each waypoint, the robot navigated successfully, as indicated by the transitions through the various states of the navigation action (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) and ultimately reaching each goal.
