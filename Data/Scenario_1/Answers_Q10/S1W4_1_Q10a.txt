Based on the ROS log messages provided, the robot's task was to navigate autonomously to a series of specified waypoints. The sequence of operations and log entries indicate that the robot used the `move_base` action server to reach multiple waypoints defined by their x and y coordinates. Here is a concise breakdown of the task sequence:

1. **Initializer Steps**:
    - The robot loaded and started various controllers (e.g., arm, torso, head, mobile base).
    - The `move_base` action server was initialized.

2. **Waypoint Navigation**:
    - The robot received a series of navigation goals, each with specific x and y coordinates.
    - For each goal, the following occurred:
        1. Transition to the ACTIVE state indicating the robot was starting the navigation.
        2. Navigation towards the waypoint.
        3. Transition to the WAITING_FOR_RESULT state indicating the robot had reached the goal but was awaiting result confirmation.
        4. Transition to the DONE state confirming the goal was successfully reached.

The specific waypoints the robot navigated to were:

1. Goal 1: x = -1.0, y = 1.0
2. Goal 2: x = 0.0, y = -3.5
3. Goal 3: x = 2.0, y = -6.0
4. Goal 4: x = 1.5, y = -11.5

The task was completed successfully as indicated by the robot reaching each of the specified waypoints and the corresponding log transitions to the DONE state for each goal.
