The robot's task was to autonomously navigate through a series of predefined waypoints. This involved:

1. **Tucking its arm:** Likely to ensure the arm is in a safe and secure position for movement.
2. **Starting various controllers:** Controllers such as the imu_sensor_controller, joint_state_controller, torso_controller, head_controller, arm_controller, mobile_base_controller, hand_controller, and force_torque_sensor_controller.
3. **Connecting to the move_base action server**: To receive navigation goals and manage locomotion.
4. **Sending navigation goals to move_base**: The robot was given specific coordinates for each waypoint.
5. **Transitioning through states**: The robot transitioned through different states such as WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE while navigating to each waypoint.
6. **Reaching and confirming goals**: Successfully reaching the specified waypoints (x, y coordinates).

In summary, the robotâ€™s task was to accurately navigate to three specific waypoints in sequence:
1. Waypoint 1: x=-2.0, y=-1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x=-4.0, y=-1.0
3. Waypoint 3: x=2.0, y=-4.0
