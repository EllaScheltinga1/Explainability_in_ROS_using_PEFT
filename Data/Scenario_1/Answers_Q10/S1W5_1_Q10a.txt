The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. The ROS log messages indicate that the robot was first prepared by tucking its arm and starting several controllers necessary for movement and sensing (e.g., force_torque_sensor_controller, mobile_base_controller). It then connected to the move_base action server, after which it received and navigated to five distinct waypoints in sequence. At each waypoint, the robot confirmed successful arrival by transitioning through various states such as ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE, culminating in reaching the designated goal coordinates.
