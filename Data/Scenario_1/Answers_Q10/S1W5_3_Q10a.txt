The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to a series of specified waypoints. This is evident from the log entries indicating the robot's movement through multiple waypoints with coordinates provided for each goal. The process involves initiating goals, transitioning through various states reflecting the status of these goals (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE), and confirming the successful reach of each waypoint. Here are the core steps involved:

1. **Initial Setup and Controller Start:** The robot's controllers for various sensors and joints were started, including force_torque_sensor_controller, imu_sensor_controller, joint_state_controller, torso_controller, head_controller, arm_controller, mobile_base_controller, and hand_controller.

2. **Move Base Action Server Connection:** The robot connected to the move_base action server, which manages autonomous movement.

3. **Waypoint Navigation:**
   - **Waypoint 1:** The robot navigated to the coordinates (x=-3.5, y=0.0).
   - **Waypoint 2:** The robot navigated to the coordinates (x=1.0, y=-3.0).
   - **Waypoint 3:** The robot navigated to the coordinates (x=0.0, y=-4.0).
   - **Waypoint 4:** The robot navigated to the coordinates (x=1.0, y=-12.0).
   - **Waypoint 5:** The robot navigated to the coordinates (x=-4.0, y=-12.0).

For each waypoint, the log shows the transition through states from setting the goal to reaching the goal, confirming that the robot successfully performed the navigation task.
