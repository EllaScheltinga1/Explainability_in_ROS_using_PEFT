The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation. This is indicated by the sequence of log messages where the goal was sent to the `move_base` action server with specified coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-3.5). The robot navigated to the designated waypoint 1, transitioned through various states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE), and successfully reached the specified goal.
