The log messages indicate that the following waypoints were received and navigated to by the autonomous robot:

1. Waypoint 1: \( x = -4.0 \), \( y = -2.0 \)
2. Waypoint 2: \( x = 1.0 \), \( y = -2.5 \)
3. Waypoint 3: \( x = 1.0 \), \( y = -5.0 \)
4. Waypoint 4: \( x = -3.0 \), \( y = -6.0 \)

These coordinates represent the goals sent to the `move_base` action server for navigation.
