- **Waypoint 1**: Coordinates \( x = 1.0 \), \( y = -7.5 \)

The log indicates the following events related to this waypoint:
1. The goal was sent to move_base.
2. The robot transitioned through several states (`ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and `DONE`).
3. Eventually, the robot reached the goal as indicated by "GOAL Reached!"
