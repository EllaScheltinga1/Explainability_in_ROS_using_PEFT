The log messages indicate that the following waypoints were received with their respective coordinates:

1. Waypoint 1: x = -1.0, y = 1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x = 0.0, y = -3.5
3. Waypoint 3: x = 2.0, y = -6.0
4. Waypoint 4: x = 1.5, y = -11.5

Each waypoint was sent to the `move_base` action server sequentially, and the robot navigated to these points successfully.
