The robot received and navigated to the following waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1:** \( x = -3.5 \), \( y = 0.0 \)
2. **Waypoint 2:** \( x = 1.0 \), \( y = -3.0 \)
3. **Waypoint 3:** \( x = 0.0 \), \( y = -4.0 \)
4. **Waypoint 4:** \( x = 1.0 \), \( y = -12.0 \)
5. **Waypoint 5:** \( x = -4.0 \), \( y = -12.0 \)

These coordinates were sequentially sent to the `move_base` action server for navigation.
