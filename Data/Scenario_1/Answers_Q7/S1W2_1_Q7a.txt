Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that the robot successfully navigated to both waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1:**
   - Goal: `x=-4.0, y=-4.5`
   - The robot successfully transitioned through the states: ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE.
   - Final log message: "Reached waypoint 1"

2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - Goal: `x=-2.5, y=-11.0`
   - The robot again transitioned through the states: ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE.
   - Final log message: "Reached waypoint 2"

The consistent transitions to the "DONE" state and confirmation messages "Reached waypoint X" indicate that the robot completed its navigation tasks as planned, hence confirming the feasibility of both paths.
