Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The ROS log messages indicate that both navigation goals were successfully reached. Here is the evidence from the log messages:

1. **Waypoint 1**:
   - The log shows the goal to move_base with coordinates \( x=3.0, y=-4.5 \).
   - The robot transitioned to ACTIVE state, indicating it started navigating towards the goal.
   - It then transitioned to the WAITING_FOR_RESULT state and subsequently to DONE, indicating that the goal was achieved.
   - The log confirms, "Reached waypoint 1".

2. **Waypoint 2**:
   - The log shows the goal to move_base with coordinates \( x=-2.0, y=-5.5 \).
   - The robot transitioned to ACTIVE state, indicating it started navigating towards the goal.
   - It then transitioned to the WAITING_FOR_RESULT state and subsequently to DONE, indicating that the goal was achieved.
   - The log confirms, "Reached waypoint 2".

The transitions of states and confirmations of reaching both waypoints indicate that the robot successfully navigated all planned paths, thereby proving the feasibility of the paths.
