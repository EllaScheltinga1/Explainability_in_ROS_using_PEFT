Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Each goal sent to the `move_base` action server was successfully reached as indicated by the following sequence of messages for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=3.0, y=1.0)**:
    - Goal sent
    - Transition to ACTIVE state
    - GOAL Reached
    - Transition to DONE state
    - Reached waypoint 1

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-2.0, y=-5.5)**:
    - Goal sent
    - Transition to ACTIVE state
    - GOAL Reached
    - Transition to DONE state
    - Reached waypoint 2

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-4.0, y=-9.0)**:
    - Goal sent
    - Transition to ACTIVE state
    - GOAL Reached
    - Transition to DONE state
    - Reached waypoint 3

4. **Waypoint 4 (x=1.0, y=-11.0)**:
    - Goal sent
    - Transition to ACTIVE state
    - GOAL Reached
    - Transition to DONE state
    - Reached waypoint 4

5. **Waypoint 5 (x=0.0, y=1.0)**:
    - Goal sent
    - Transition to ACTIVE state
    - GOAL Reached
    - Transition to DONE state
    - Reached waypoint 5

The consistent pattern of successfully reaching each goal without any errors or deviations indicates that all planned paths were feasible and correctly navigated by the robot.
