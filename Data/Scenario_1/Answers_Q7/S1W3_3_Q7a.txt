Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. According to the ROS log messages, the robot successfully reached all three waypoints. Each goal sent to the `move_base` action server resulted in a successful "GOAL Reached!" message, followed by a progression to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and ultimately to "DONE". This sequence of transitions indicates that the robot successfully navigated to and achieved each target position without encountering insurmountable obstacles or errors.
