Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that the robot successfully navigated to all specified waypoints without encountering any issues. For each goal sent to `move_base`, the following sequence of events is consistently observed:

1. The goal is sent with specific coordinates.
2. The system transitions to the `ACTIVE` state.
3. The robot reaches the goal, indicated by "GOAL Reached!".
4. The system transitions to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`.
5. Finally, the system transitions to the `DONE` state.

This consistent and successful sequence for waypoints 1 through 5 demonstrates that the robot could navigate all the planned paths without any obstacles or failures.
