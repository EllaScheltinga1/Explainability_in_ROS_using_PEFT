Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached each waypoint without any errors or issues. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the navigation to each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1**: x=1.0, y=-5.0
   - Goal sent to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Reached the waypoint.

2. **Waypoint 2**: x=-2.5, y=-5.5
   - Goal sent to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Reached the waypoint.

3. **Waypoint 3**: x=-4.0, y=-9.0
   - Goal sent to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Reached the waypoint.

4. **Waypoint 4**: x=1.0, y=-11.0
   - Goal sent to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Reached the waypoint.

5. **Waypoint 5**: x=2.0, y=-4.0
   - Goal sent to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Reached the waypoint.

In all cases, the robot successfully transitioned through the states of sending the goal, becoming active, waiting for the result, and finally completing the task (DONE) at each waypoint, indicating that all planned paths were feasible.
