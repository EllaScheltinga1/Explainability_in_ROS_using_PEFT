Based on the provided ROS log messages, it appears that all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Sending goal to move_base**: The robot received a waypoint goal (x=-3.5, y=-3.5) and sent it to the `move_base` action server.
   
2. **Transition Process**:
   - The robot transitioned from `WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK` to `ACTIVE`, indicating it began navigating towards the goal.
   - It then transitioned from `ACTIVE` to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, indicating it had reached the goal and was waiting for the confirmation.
   - Finally, it transitioned from `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` to `DONE`, indicating that the goal was successfully reached.

3. **Confirmation**:
   - The log entry "GOAL Reached!" confirms that the navigation to the waypoint was successful.

From these details, there are no indications of any infeasible paths or errors during the navigation task, hence all planned paths were feasible.
