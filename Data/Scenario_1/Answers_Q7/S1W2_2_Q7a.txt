Based on the ROS log messages provided, it appears that all planned paths during the navigation task were feasible. The robot successfully transitioned through all the necessary states and reached both waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1:**
   - Sent goal 1 to `move_base` with coordinates (x=1.0, y=-4.5).
   - Transitioned to `ACTIVE`.
   - Played motion successfully.
   - Reached the goal, transitioning to `DONE`.
   - Confirmed to have reached waypoint 1.

2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - Sent goal 2 to `move_base` with coordinates (x=2.0, y=-10.5).
   - Transitioned to `ACTIVE`.
   - Reached the goal, transitioning to `DONE`.
   - Confirmed to have reached waypoint 2.

No errors or infeasibility issues were reported in the log messages for either waypoint. Therefore, all planned paths were feasible.
