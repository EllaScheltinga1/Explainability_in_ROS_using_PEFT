Based on the provided ROS log messages, it appears that all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Here is the reasoning:

1. "Waiting for move_base action server..."
2. "Connected to move_base action server."
3. "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-7.5"
4. "Navigating to waypoint 1..."
5. "Transitioning to ACTIVE (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
6. "Motion played successfully."
7. "Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
8. "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
9. "GOAL Reached!"

These steps confirm that the robot successfully navigated to the goal without any indications of failures or infeasible paths. The transitions to different states (WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) suggest that the robot continued its navigation process without interruptions or errors up to the point where it reached its goal.
