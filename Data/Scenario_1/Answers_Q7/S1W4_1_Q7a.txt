Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully transitioned through various states indicating successful navigation:

1. For each goal sent to the `move_base` action server, the robot transitioned to the `ACTIVE` state, indicating that it began navigating towards the goal.
2. The robot then transitioned to the `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` state, meaning the robot was actively checking for completion.
3. Once the goal was reached, it transitioned to the `DONE` state.
4. Achieving the `GOAL Reached!` message for each waypoint confirms that the robot successfully navigated to all planned waypoints.

This sequence of state transitions and successful goal completion messages for waypoints 1 through 4 indicates that the robot did not encounter any issues with the planned paths. Thus, all planned paths were feasible and successfully navigated.
