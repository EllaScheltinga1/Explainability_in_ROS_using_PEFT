Based on the provided log messages, it appears that the planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically:

1. The goal was sent to `move_base` with coordinates \(x=3.0, y=1.0\).
2. The robot transitioned through the different states indicating a successful navigation process:
   - Transitioning to ACTIVE (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK)
   - Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE)
   - Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT)
3. The robot ultimately reached the goal (waypoint 1).

All these transitions and the final message "Reached waypoint 1\" indicate that the navigation task was successfully completed, implying that all planned paths to the waypoint were feasible. There are no logs suggesting any issues or infeasibilities encountered during the navigation.
