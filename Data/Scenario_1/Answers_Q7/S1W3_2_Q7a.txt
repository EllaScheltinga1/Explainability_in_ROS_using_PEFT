Based on the ROS log messages, it appears that all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached each goal without any indications of failure or issues. Here are the relevant details from the log messages for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=2.0, y=-6.5):**
   - Sent goal to move_base.
   - Log message indicates transitioning to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE.
   - "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 1" confirm successful navigation.

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-2.0, y=-6.0):**
   - Sent goal to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE.
   - "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 2" confirm the second successful navigation.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-3.0, y=-12.0):**
   - Sent goal to move_base.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE.
   - "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 3" confirm the third successful navigation.

Each planned path leading to the waypoints was navigated successfully, indicating that all paths were feasible.
