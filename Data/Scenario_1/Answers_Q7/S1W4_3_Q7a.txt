Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that the robot successfully reached all the waypoints specified in its goals. Here's a breakdown of the navigation success:

1. **Waypoint 1**:
    - Goal: x=0.0, y=0.0
    - Status: Goal reached, transitioned to DONE

2. **Waypoint 2**:
    - Goal: x=-4.0, y=0.0
    - Status: Goal reached, transitioned to DONE

3. **Waypoint 3**:
    - Goal: x=0.0, y=-4.0
    - Status: Goal reached, transitioned to DONE

4. **Waypoint 4**:
    - Goal: x=-3.0, y=-6.0
    - Status: Goal reached, transitioned to DONE

For each of these goals, the log transitions from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE, all indicating successful navigation without errors or interruptions.
