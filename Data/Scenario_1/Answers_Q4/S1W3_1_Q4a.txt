Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached according to the ROS log messages. The sequence of events for each waypoint includes sending a goal to the `move_base` action server, navigating to the waypoint, transitioning through different states (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT), and finally, reaching the goal as indicated by the "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint" log entries.

Here is the breakdown for each waypoint:
1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-2.0, y=-1.0)**:
   - "Sending goal 1 to move_base"
   - "Navigating to waypoint 1"
   - "GOAL Reached!"
   - "Reached waypoint 1"

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-4.0, y=-1.0)**:
   - "Sending goal 2 to move_base"
   - "Navigating to waypoint 2"
   - "GOAL Reached!"
   - "Reached waypoint 2"

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=2.0, y=-4.0)**:
   - "Sending goal 3 to move_base"
   - "Navigating to waypoint 3"
   - "GOAL Reached!"
   - "Reached waypoint 3"

In each case, the transition to the DONE state and the confirmation message "Reached waypoint" indicate successful navigation to each waypoint.
