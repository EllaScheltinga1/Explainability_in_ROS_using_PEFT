Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached by the robot as indicated by the log messages. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1:**
   - The goal was sent with coordinates \( x = -4.0 \) and \( y = -4.5 \).
   - The navigation status transitioned from **WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK** to **ACTIVE**, then to **WAITING_FOR_RESULT**, and finally to **DONE**.
   - Message "Reached waypoint 1" confirms that the robot arrived at the first waypoint.

2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - The goal was sent with coordinates \( x = -2.5 \) and \( y = -11.0 \).
   - The navigation status transitioned from **WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK** to **ACTIVE**, then to **WAITING_FOR_RESULT**, and finally to **DONE**.
   - Message "Reached waypoint 2" confirms that the robot arrived at the second waypoint.

Therefore, both waypoints were successfully reached as per the log messages.
