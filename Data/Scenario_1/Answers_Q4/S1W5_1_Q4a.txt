Yes, all the received waypoints were successfully reached. The sequence of log messages shows that for each waypoint goal sent to `move_base`, the robot transitioned to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE. Each transition to DONE is accompanied by the message "GOAL Reached!" and a confirmation that the specific waypoint was reached. Therefore, waypoints 1 through 5 were all successfully navigated to and reached by the robot.
