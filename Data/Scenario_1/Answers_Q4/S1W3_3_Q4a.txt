Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log messages indicate that for each goal sent to the `move_base` action server, the robot transitioned through the expected states: from `ACTIVE` to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and finally to `DONE`, with a confirmation message that the waypoint was reached.

   - `Reached waypoint 2`

3. Waypoint 3 (x=2.0, y=-11.0):
