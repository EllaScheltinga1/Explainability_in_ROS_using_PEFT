Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. Each goal sent to the `move_base` action server transitioned through the necessary states (from `WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK` to `ACTIVE`, then to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and finally to `DONE`). Additionally, the log explicitly states "Reached waypoint X" for each waypoint, confirming successful navigation to all given coordinates.
