Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The logs indicate that the robot transitioned through the appropriate states (WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) for each waypoint and reached the corresponding coordinates. Specifically:

1. For waypoint 1 (x=1.0, y=-4.5):
   - The robot connected to the `move_base` action server.
   - Sent goal 1 to `move_base`.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE state.
   - Successfully played the motion and reached the goal.
   - Transitioned to DONE state.
   - Confirmed reaching waypoint 1.

2. For waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=-10.5):
   - Sent goal 2 to `move_base`.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE state.
   - Successfully reached the goal.
   - Transitioned to DONE state.
   - Confirmed reaching waypoint 2.

Thus, both waypoints were successfully reached as per the log messages.
