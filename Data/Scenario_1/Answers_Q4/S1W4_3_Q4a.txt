Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The logs show that for each waypoint goal sent to the `move_base` action server, the robot transitioned through various states and eventually reached the `DONE` state, indicating successful completion of each goal. Specifically:

1. For waypoint 1: successful transition to `DONE` after reaching the goal.
2. For waypoint 2: successful transition to `DONE` after reaching the goal.
3. For waypoint 3: successful transition to `DONE` after reaching the goal.
4. For waypoint 4: successful transition to `DONE` after reaching the goal.

Thus, the robot successfully navigated to and reached all specified waypoints.
