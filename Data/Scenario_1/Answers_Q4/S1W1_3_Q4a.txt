Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log messages indicate the robot sent a goal to the `move_base` action server with coordinates `x=1.0, y=-7.5` for waypoint 1. The robot transitioned through various states (`ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`) and ultimately the status transitioned to `DONE`, indicating that the goal/waypoint was reached successfully. The message "GOAL Reached!" confirms this successful completion. Since there are no logs indicating failures or additional waypoints, it can be concluded that the received waypoints were successfully reached.
