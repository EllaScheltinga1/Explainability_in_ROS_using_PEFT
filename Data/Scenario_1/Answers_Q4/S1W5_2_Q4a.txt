Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. 

For each waypoint goal sent to `move_base`, the logs show the following sequence:
1. **Transitioning to ACTIVE:** Indicating that the robot has started navigating towards the goal.
2. **GOAL Reached:** Confirming that the robot has arrived at the specified coordinates.
3. **Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT:** Showing the transition after the goal is reached.
4. **Transitioning to DONE:** Indicating the completion of the navigation to the goal.

This sequence is repeated five times, corresponding to the five waypoints (coordinates x=3.0, y=1.0; x=-2.0, y=-5.5; x=-4.0, y=-9.0; x=1.0, y=-11.0; and x=0.0, y=1.0). Consequently, it can be concluded that all waypoints were successfully reached.
