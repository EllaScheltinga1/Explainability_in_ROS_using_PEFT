Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is evidence that at least one waypoint (waypoint 1) was successfully reached. The log shows the following sequence for waypoint 1:

1. The goal for waypoint 1 was sent: `Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=3.0, y=1.0`.
2. The transition to the ACTIVE state: `Transitioning to ACTIVE (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.128)`.
3. The confirmation that the motion was successfully executed: `Motion played successfully`.
4. The notification of reaching the goal: `GOAL Reached!`.
5. The transition through subsequent states until completion: `Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT` and `Transitioning to DONE`.

These messages collectively indicate that waypoint 1 was reached successfully.

However, the log does not provide information on other waypoints. Therefore, based on the provided log, we can confirm that waypoint 1 was reached, but there is no evidence to determine whether all possible waypoints were reached.
