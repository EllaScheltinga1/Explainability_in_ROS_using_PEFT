The ROS log messages you provided do not indicate any obstacles encountered during the navigation task. The messages describe a smooth sequence of events where the autonomous robot successfully transitioned through various states (such as *WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK*, *ACTIVE*, *WAITING_FOR_RESULT*, and *DONE*) and reached both waypoints without any reported incidents or errors. Additionally, the transitions in states like "GOAL Reached!" further confirm that the robot reached its designated waypoints without issues. Typically, if there were obstacles or issues, you would expect to see error or warning messages detailing those events, but no such messages are present here.
