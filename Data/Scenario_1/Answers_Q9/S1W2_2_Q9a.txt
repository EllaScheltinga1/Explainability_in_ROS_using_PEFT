Based on the provided ROS log messages, there are no indications that any obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. The logs show that the goals were sent to the `move_base` action server and the robot successfully navigated to both waypoints with smooth transitions between statuses (e.g., from `ACTIVE` to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` and then to `DONE`). Messages state "GOAL Reached!" for both waypoints, implying that the robot navigated without interruption or difficulty.
