Based on the provided ROS log messages, there are no indications of any obstacles being encountered during the navigation task. The log mentions the following key points:

1. **Connecting to the move_base action server**: "Connected to move_base action server."
2. **Sending a goal to move_base**: "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-7.5"
3. **Navigating transitions**:
   - "Transitioning to ACTIVE (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
   - "Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
   - "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.166)"
4. **Successful goal completion**: "GOAL Reached!\."

The smooth transitions between states and the final statement indicating that the goal was reached successfully suggest that the navigation was completed without any detection of obstacles. Typically, if there had been any obstacles, there would be log messages indicating actions taken to avoid them or errors reported by the navigation system.
