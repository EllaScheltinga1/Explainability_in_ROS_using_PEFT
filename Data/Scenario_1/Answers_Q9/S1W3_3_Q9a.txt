Based on the ROS log messages provided, there is no indication that any obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. The robot consistently transitioned from setting a goal to actively navigating and successfully reaching the goal without any interruptions or error messages. Each waypoint was reached successfully, and the goal status transitioned smoothly from ACTIVE to WAITING_FOR_RESULT to DONE. This suggests that the navigation task was completed without any issues related to obstacles.
