Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication that the robot encountered any obstacles during the navigation task. The log entries show a smooth transition between different states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) and indicate that all goals were reached successfully:

1. **Goal 1:** 
   - Successfully transitioned through all states and reached the waypoint.
2. **Goal 2:** 
   - Successfully transitioned through all states and reached the waypoint.
3. **Goal 3:** 
   - Successfully transitioned through all states and reached the waypoint.
4. **Goal 4:**
   - Successfully transitioned through all states and reached the waypoint.
5. **Goal 5:**
   - Successfully transitioned through all states and reached the waypoint.

If the robot had encountered any obstacles, there would likely be log entries indicating issues, re-routing, or error messages. The absence of such entries suggests that the navigation was obstacle-free.
