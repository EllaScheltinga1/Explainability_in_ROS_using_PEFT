Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication of obstacles being encountered during the navigation task. The log shows that the robot successfully transitioned through the states ("ACTIVE," "WAITING_FOR_RESULT," "DONE") and reached both waypoints without any mentions of errors, delays, or obstacle-related events. The smooth transitions and successful goal completions suggest that no obstacles interfered with the navigation process.
