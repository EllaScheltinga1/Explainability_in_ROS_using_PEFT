Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication of any obstacles encountered during the navigation tasks. Each waypoint was reached successfully with smooth transitions between the states:

1. **Waiting for Move Base Action Server**
2. **Connecting to the Move Base Action Server**
3. **Sending Goal**
4. **Navigating**
5. **Transitioning to ACTIVE**
6. **Reaching GOAL**
7. **Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT**
8. **Transitioning to DONE**

The logs do not mention any retries, errors, or delays that would suggest obstacles or issues were encountered during navigation. Each goal was reached successfully and the robot transitioned through the states as expected.
