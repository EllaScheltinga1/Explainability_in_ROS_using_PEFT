The ROS log messages do not indicate any obstacles encountered during the navigation task. The robot successfully transitions through various states such as **ACTIVE**, **WAITING_FOR_RESULT**, and **DONE** for each waypoint without mentioning any hindrances or failures. Each goal is marked as "GOAL Reached!" upon completion, suggesting that the robot reached all its waypoints smoothly. The absence of error messages or notifications about obstacles in the logs further supports this conclusion.
