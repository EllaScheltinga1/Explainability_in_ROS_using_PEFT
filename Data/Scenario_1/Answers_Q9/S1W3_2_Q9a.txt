Based on the provided log messages, there is no indication that any obstacles were encountered during the navigation tasks. The logs show a smooth transition from one waypoint to the next, with all goals being reached successfully. Each goal is sent to the move_base action server, and the robot transitions through various states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) without any reported interruptions or errors. 

Here is a summary of the log steps:
1. Tuck arm operations completed.
2. Various controllers started.
3. Connected to the move_base action server.
4. Goals for waypoints 1, 2, and 3 were sent, and each was navigated to successfully.
5. Transitions between states were smooth, indicating no issues.

Therefore, this sequence suggests that the robot did not encounter any obstacles during its navigation tasks.
