Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication that any obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. Each goal sent to the `move_base` action server was successfully transitioned through the states `ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and `DONE`, culminating in the robot reaching all prescribed waypoints. Moreover, there are no log entries detailing periods of failure, retries, or obstacle avoidance maneuvers, which are commonly logged when a robot encounters and deals with obstacles.

Thus, we can conclude that the navigation task was completed smoothly with no obstacles encountered.
