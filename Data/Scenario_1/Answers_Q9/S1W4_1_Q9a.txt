Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no indication that the robot encountered any obstacles during the navigation task. The logs show a smooth transition through various states (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK to ACTIVE, then to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and finally to DONE) for all waypoints, with "GOAL Reached!" messages confirming successful navigation to each waypoint (1 through 4).

Any mention of obstacles usually appears as error messages, warnings, or specific obstacle detection logs, none of which are present in the provided log. Therefore, it can be inferred that the robot did not experience any obstacles during its navigation task.
