There was an attempt to clear the costmaps to generate a new plan: \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\"\n5. Despite these efforts, it finally resulted in \"Failed to reach waypoint 4\" indicating that the path was ultimately not feasible.\n\nThis issue did not occur for other waypoints, as the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 5."

Resetting planner...**: This indicates that the trajectory generated by the local planner was determined to be infeasible, prompting the planner to reset.\n4. **Failed to reach waypoint 2**: This confirms that despite several attempts and replanning efforts, the robot failed to reach the second waypoint due to the infeasibility of the planned paths around the obstacle. \n\nThus, it is clear that not all paths were feasible, particularly for the navigation attempt to waypoint 2."

This triggered multiple replanning attempts and recovery behaviors, but it ultimately failed to find a valid path and aborted the mission.

These waypoints are defined by specific coordinates provided to the `move_base` action server. The log messages indicate that the robot navigated sequentially to each waypoint, experiencing various states and handling obstacles during its journey. Here is a summary of the robot's tasks:\n\n1. **Navigate to Waypoint 1**: Coordinates (x=1.5, y=0.0). The robot successfully reached this waypoint.\n   \n2. **Navigate to Waypoint 2**: Coordinates (x=-4.0, y=1.0). The robot encountered an obstacle and was unable to reach this waypoint despite replanning its path.\n   \n3. **Navigate to Waypoint 3**: Coordinates (x=1.0, y=-4.5). After replanning to avoid obstacles, the robot successfully reached this waypoint.\n\n4. **Navigate to Waypoint 4**: Coordinates (x=1.0, y=-11.0). The robot successfully reached this waypoint without issues.\n\nThroughout these tasks, the robot's controllers, sensors, and planners were activated and utilized to achieve autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, and path replanning."

Goal 3: x=-1.0, y=-1.0\n4. Goal 4: x=2.0, y=-7.0 (failed to reach due to obstacles)\n5. Goal 5: x=2.0, y=-0.5\n\nThe robot had to handle obstacle detections, replan paths when obstacles were detected or the trajectory was not feasible, and clear costmaps to attempt recalculating viable paths."

Sending Navigation Goals:\n   - The robot connects to the move_base action server to handle navigation.\n   - The robot is given sequential goals to reach specific coordinates:\n     - Goal 1: x=-3.5, y=-8.0\n     - Goal 2: x=-4.0, y=-1.0\n     - Goal 3: x=-4.0, y=1.0\n\n3. Navigation:\n   - The robot attempts to navigate to each of these goals in sequence.\n   - While attempting to reach Goal 1, the robot encounters an obstacle and fails to get a feasible path, requiring it to replan and clear costmaps. Eventually, it fails to reach Goal 1.\n   - The robot then successfully navigates to Goal 2 and Goal 3, with the log showing successful transitions through various navigation states (such as ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) and indicating when the goals are reached.\n\nIn summary, the robot's task is to autonomously navigate to a series of predefined waypoints while handling dynamic obstacles and replanning its path as necessary."

The robot then moved on to attempt reaching waypoint 3 with renewed navigation instructions."

        "question": "How did the robot respond to the detected obstacle?",
        "answers": "The robot responded to the detected obstacle through a series of actions aimed at replanning its path and recovering from the issue:\n\n1. **Path Replanning**: Upon nearing the obstacle, the log messages indicate that the robot's path was being replanned several times. Specifically, it states \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.\" This suggests that the robot's navigation system attempted to find an alternative trajectory to avoid the obstacle.\n\n2. **Resetting the Planner**: The logs mentioned \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" multiple times. This means that the current planned trajectory was determined to be infeasible by the TEB local planner, leading the system to reset the planning process and attempt to find a different path.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**: The log \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\" indicates that the robot also tried to clear its environmental representations (costmaps) to possibly remove any erroneous obstacle information and aid in better replanning.\n\n4. **Recovery Strategy Activation**: The log \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\" shows that the robot detected an oscillation, an undesirable repetitive motion, and therefore activated a recovery strategy to handle the situation.\n\nDespite these attempts at replanning, resetting the planner, and clearing costmaps, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1, indicating that the obstacle or the path planning issues could not be fully resolved within the scope of the mentioned log messages."

The robot tried to replan the path multiple times when nearing the obstacle. This included several attempts to get a new plan which failed and triggering a planner reset due to a trajectory feasibility issue. The costmaps were cleared to enhance planning flexibility. Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach Waypoint 4.\n\n3. **Modified Behavior**:\n    - **Waypoint 5**: Despite the same obstacle, the robot was able to navigate and reach the goal. It performed a successful path replan when nearing the obstacle, indicating improved handling at this stage.\n\nIn summary, the robot predominantly attempted to replan its path when encountering the obstacle. Its success varied, as it failed to overcome the obstacle at Waypoint 4 but successfully navigated past it on other occasions."

However, it still failed to generate a viable plan.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**: In an effort to improve planning capabilities, the robot cleared both local and global costmaps starting with a large area (3.00m square) and then a smaller, more focused area (1.50m square) centered on the robot.\n   \n4. **Further Replanning Attempts**: Despite these actions, the robot continued to identify itself as nearing the obstacle and made additional attempts to replan its path.\n\n5. **Failure to Reach the Waypoint**: Eventually, due to the continual failures in planning around the obstacle, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1.\n\nIn summary, upon detecting the obstacle, the robot engaged in multiple rounds of path replanning, trajectory reset, and costmap clearing attempts but was ultimately unable to navigate around the obstacle to reach its initial goal. Following these unsuccessful attempts, the robot proceeded to navigate to subsequent goals, successfully reaching waypoints 2 and 3 without further complications mentioned."

However, it ultimately aborted the mission due to repeated failures in path planning."

        "question": "How did the robot respond to the detected obstacle?",
        "answers": "The robot's response to the detected obstacle involved several specific actions and strategies aimed at navigating or avoiding the obstacle. Here's a detailed breakdown of the responses:\n\n1. **Obstacle Detection**: \n   - The obstacle was initially detected at position (3.5, -11.0) when the robot was navigating to waypoint 1 and subsequently while attempting to navigate to waypoints 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Path Replanning**:\n   - Upon detecting the obstacle, the robot attempted to replan its path multiple times to find a feasible route around the obstacle.\n\n3. **Trajectory Feasibility**:\n   - The `TebLocalPlannerROS` (Time-Elastic Band Local Planner for ROS) detected that the planned trajectories were not feasible and thus reset the planner multiple times.\n\n4. **Oscillation Recovery**:\n   - The system identified potential oscillations (repeated minor adjustments or back-and-forth movements) and attempted an oscillation recovery strategy. This involved activating a recovery behavior to prefer the current turning direction during optimization.\n\n5. **Costmap Clearing**:\n   - The robot cleared both the local and global costmaps within a certain radius around itself. This action was performed in an attempt to remove stale, potentially misleading information about obstacles:\n     - Initially, it cleared an area of 3.00 meters centered on the robot.\n     - This was followed by clearing a smaller area of 1.50 meters when trajectory infeasibility persisted.\n\n6. **Recovery and Replanning Attempts**:\n   - The planner was constantly reset and recovery strategies were applied repeatedly as the robot continued to encounter infeasible trajectories. This cycle continued several times in an attempt to find a viable path.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 2 and waypoint 3 due to the persistent obstacle and infeasible trajectories. This indicates that the robot engaged in multiple standard navigation recovery behaviors but was unable to overcome the difficulties presented by the detected obstacle."

Here are the specific actions taken by the robot:\n\n1. **Replanning the Path**: Initially, the robot identified the new obstacle and began replanning its path to avoid the detected obstacle (\"Path is being replanned\").\n\n2. **Trajectory Feasibility Check**: The *TebLocalPlannerROS* component assessed the feasibility of the new trajectory and found it to be infeasible (\"trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\").\n\n3. **Repeated Replanning Attempts**: The robot again attempted to replan its path (\"Path is being replanned\") but continued to face difficulties.\n\n4. **Oscillation Detection and Recovery**: The *TebLocalPlannerROS* detected possible oscillations, which might be due to the robot's movements or the local planning adjustments. In response, it activated a recovery strategy to prefer the current turning direction during optimization (\"possible oscillation detected...Activating recovery strategy\").\n\n5. **Clearing Costmaps**: As a further step to resolve the navigation issues, the robot cleared both local and global costmaps outside a 3-meter square area centered on the robot (\"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large...\").\n\nDespite these efforts, the combination of replanning, feasibility checks, and recovery strategies were not enough to overcome the obstacle, resulting in the robot's failure to reach waypoint 5 (\"Failed to reach waypoint 5\")."

Even after executing all recovery behaviors`\n   - `Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.207)`\n   - `Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.207)`\n   - `Failed to reach waypoint 1.`\n\nIn summary, the robot's response involved detecting the obstacle, attempting to replan its route, executing recovery behaviors to clear the path, and finally aborting the navigation attempt upon repeated failures to generate a viable trajectory."

The robot successfully reached the goal despite the obstacle.\n\n2. **At Waypoint 2 (Position: x=1.0, y=0.0):**\n    - **Detection:** The same obstacle was detected again at position (1.5, -2.5).\n    - **Response:** Similar to Waypoint 1, the log notes the detection but doesn't detail any specific actions beyond successful goal achievement.\n\n3. **At Waypoint 3 (Position: x=3.0, y=-4.5):**\n    - **Detection:** The robot neared an obstacle multiple times, triggering path replanning. \n    - **Response:**\n        - **Path Replanning:** Replanned the path multiple times to attempt to navigate around the obstacle.\n        - **Oscillation Detection:** The TebLocalPlannerROS detected possible oscillation and activated a recovery strategy, which involved preferring the current turning direction during optimization.\n        - **Costmap Clearing:** Cleared both costmaps outside a square, initially 3.00m and then 1.50m large, centered on the robot to reassess the environment and attempt to find a viable path.\n    - The robot ultimately failed to reach Waypoint 3 due to the obstacle.\n\n4. **At Waypoint 4 (Position: x=3.0, y=0.0):**\n    - **Detection:** The robot neared an obstacle, leading to path replanning.\n    - **Response:**\n        - **Path Replanning:** Multiple instances of path replanning to navigate around the obstacle.\n        - **Costmap Clearing:** Cleared both costmaps outside a 3.00m square centered on the robot.\n        - **Oscillation Recovery Expiration:** The TebLocalPlannerROS indicated that oscillation recovery was disabled/expired.\n    - The robot successfully reached Waypoint 4 despite the presence of obstacles.\n\nThroughout these events, the robot used strategies like path replanning, oscillation recovery, and costmap clearing in its attempts to navigate around obstacles."

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "One or more paths were deemed not feasible by the `TebLocalPlannerROS` due to detected obstacles and resulting oscillations. Below are detailed explanations based on the ROS log messages:\n\n1. **New Obstacle Detection**:\n   - Log: \"New obstacle detected at position (-4.0, 0.0)\"\n   - Explanation: The robot detected a new obstacle at a specific position. This likely required the path to be replanned for safe navigation.\n\n2. **Path Replanning**:\n   - Log: \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.\"\n   - Explanation: As the robot approached the detected obstacle, the navigation system initiated a path replanning process to find an alternative route.\n\n3. **Trajectory Infeasibility**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\"\n   - Explanation: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected that the planned trajectory was not feasible, possibly due to the inability to navigate around the obstacle within dynamic constraints. This necessitated resetting the path planner.\n\n4. **Oscillation Detection and Recovery**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\"\n   - Explanation: The system detected oscillation, which indicates repeated failed attempts to navigate past an obstacle or difficulty in maintaining a stable path. In response, a recovery strategy was activated to favor the current turning direction during optimization in an attempt to stabilize the navigation process.\n\n5. **Continued Infeasibility of Trajectories**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\"\n   - Explanation: Despite the recovery efforts, the planner again found the trajectory infeasible. This repeated infeasibility suggests that the obstacles or the environment posed significant challenges to path planning.\n\n6. **Failure to Reach Waypoint 2**:\n   - Log: \"Failed to reach waypoint 2.\"\n   - Explanation: All efforts to replan the path to waypoint 2 failed, likely because of the persistent obstacles and possibly due to complex or dynamically changing environments.\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of one or more paths was primarily due to the detection of new obstacles, resulting oscillations, and the inability of the path planner to find a feasible alternative route despite repeated attempts and recovery strategies."

        "answers": "The paths were deemed not feasible primarily due to the continuous detection of obstacles as indicated by the repetitive log messages. Specifically, the log entries \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.\" and \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" suggest that the robot's planned paths were continuously encountering obstacles which made them impractical to follow.\n\nMoreover, there is a mention of \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization),\" which implies there were oscillations detected in the robot's movements or its local planning. Oscillations can occur when the robot frequently changes direction or hesitates, which can be an additional sign of path feasibility issues in complex or cluttered environments.\n\nOverall, the combination of detected obstacles and oscillations led to the infeasibility of one or more paths, preventing the robot from reaching waypoint 1."

This obstacle likely blocked potential paths, leading to the failure in reaching waypoint 4.\n\n2. **Interference with Path Planning:**\n   - **Waypoint 4:** The robot tried several times to replan the path when nearing the obstacle but failed to get a feasible plan. The messages \"Failed to get a plan\" and \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" indicate the planner's inability to generate a viable trajectory to avoid the obstacle.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing:** The robot attempted to address the issue by clearing costmaps within a 3-meter square centered on the robot. However, this was not sufficient to find a clear path.\n\nThe infeasibility of these paths is a combination of the static or dynamic nature of the detected obstacle and the limitations of the robot\u2019s planning algorithms in generating viable alternate routes under these conditions."

        "answers": "Several messages in the logs indicate that the planned paths were not feasible due to a detected obstacle at the goal position (-4.0, -9.0). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the relevant log entries:\n\n1. **Obstacle Detection**:\n   - Multiple instances of \"New obstacle detected at position (-4.0, -9.0)\" appear, suggesting that the same obstacle was consistently detected at this specific location.\n   \n2. **Trajectory Planning Issues**:\n   - The log states \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.\" multiple times, indicating that the robot attempted to navigate around the obstacle but encountered difficulties.\n   - Specific messages \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" indicate that the planner utilized by the robot's local planning system (TebLocalPlannerROS) determined the trajectory to be infeasible, leading to a reset of the planner.\n\n3. **Planning and Replanning Attempts**:\n   - The system made multiple attempts to clear costmaps and replan the path:\n     - \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\"\n     - \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot.\"\n   - Each attempt to reset and recalculate the trajectory failed, as noted by the repetitive logs \"Failed to get a plan.\"\n\nFrom these logs, it is clear that the infeasibility of the paths arose due to the persistent presence of an obstacle at the goal location, coupled with repeated failures by the local planner to find a valid path around or through the obstacle. This led to unresolved planning issues that ultimately caused the robot to fail to reach waypoint 4."

This indicates the presence of a significant obstruction at the target location.\n\n2. **Path Replanning**:\n   - The robot attempted to replan its path as it neared the obstacle, but these replanning efforts repeatedly failed. The log entries state: \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned. Failed to get a plan.\"\n\n3. **Trajectory Feasibility Issue**:\n   - The specific log entry \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" indicates that the TebLocalPlannerROS, which is responsible for local trajectory planning, determined that the planned path was not viable given the current obstacle configuration.\n\n4. **Costmap Clearing**:\n   - The robot performed an action to clear its costmaps (\"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot\"), yet subsequent entries indicate continued replanning failures, suggesting that the obstacle was consistently causing infeasibility in path planning decisions.\n\nGiven these points, the paths were not feasible due to the inability to plot a viable trajectory around the obstacle detected at the target location (3.0, -7.0). This led to multiple replanning attempts and failures, resulting in the robot ultimately failing to reach waypoint 2."

        "answers": "One or more paths were not feasible primarily due to the presence of a persistent obstacle near the robot's intended path, specifically at position (-2.5, -12.0). Here are the key points detailing why the paths were not feasible:\n\n1. **Obstacle Detection**:\n    - The log messages indicate the detection of an obstacle at position (-2.5, -12.0), repeatedly noted during attempts to navigate to waypoint 3.\n   \n2. **Path Replanning**:\n    - The robot attempted to replan its path multiple times when nearing the detected obstacle. Each time, the system logged \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned,\" followed by \"Failed to get a plan,\" suggesting that the replanned paths were continuously found to be infeasible.\n    \n3. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n    - Several recovery behaviors were executed, including clearing the costmaps (outside a 3.00m and 1.50m square centered on the robot) and a rotate recovery behavior. These actions aim to recover from path-planning failures and find alternative feasible paths, but they were unsuccessful in this instance.\n    \n4. **Consistent Failures**:\n    - Despite these recovery attempts, the robot consistently failed to generate a valid navigation plan, ultimately resulting in the log entry \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors.\"\n\n5. **Final Outcome**:\n    - The robot ultimately aborted the mission to waypoint 3, transitioning to a DONE state from the WAITING_FOR_RESULT state with the conclusion \"Failed to reach waypoint 3.\"\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of one or more paths was due to the robot's inability to effectively navigate around a persistent obstacle despite multiple replanning and recovery attempts."

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "The paths were found to be not feasible for several reasons, as evidenced by the ROS log messages:\n\n1. **New Obstacles Detected**: New obstacles were detected multiple times in the robot's environment (`New obstacle detected at position (3.5, -11.0)`). These dynamic environmental changes caused the planner to frequently re-evaluate and try to find a new feasible trajectory.\n\n2. **Oscillation**: The log mentions potential oscillation issues (`TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected`). Oscillation refers to the robot, or its computed path, repeatedly switching directions or routes without making progress towards the goal. This can happen when the planner struggles to find a stable path around obstacles.\n\n3. **Trajectory Not Feasible**: Multiple reset attempts of the planner were noted (`TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...`). This indicates that the planner failed to compute a path that satisfies the robot's kinematic constraints and avoids collisions with obstacles, leading to several unsuccessful trajectory recalculations.\n\n4. **Recoveries and Costmap Clearing**: The log indicates recovery actions were undertaken, including clearing costmaps around the robot to eliminate potential errors due to outdated obstacle information (`Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot`, `Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot`). Despite these efforts, the robot still failed to find a feasible path.\n\n5. **Recovery Expiry**: At one point, oscillation recovery is noted as disabled/expired (`TebLocalPlannerROS: oscillation recovery disabled/expired`), meaning that one of the recovery mechanisms the planner relies on was no longer effective.\n\nOverall, the continuous detection of new obstacles, path oscillations, frequent trajectory feasibility resets, and recovery mechanisms failing to establish a clear, collision-free path led to the infeasibility of the paths to waypoints 2 and 3."

This implies that the local planner's proposed path could not be executed by the robot, potentially due to the proximity of obstacles or the complexity of the required maneuvers.\n\n3. **Path Replanning**: The robot repeatedly attempted to replan the path, which suggests that the initial trajectory and subsequent reattempts could not find a viable route around the obstacle.\n\n4. **Possible Oscillation**: The log mentions a \"possible oscillation\" detected by `TebLocalPlannerROS`. This indicates that either the robot or its local plan entered a state of back-and-forth movement without making progress, necessitating a recovery strategy.\n\n5. **Costmap Clearing**: The costmaps were cleared outside a specified square centered on the robot to reset the planning environment. This action is typically taken to remove temporary obstacles or inaccuracies in the map, indicating persistent difficulties in finding a stable path.\n\nCombined, these factors resulted in the failure to reach waypoint 5, as the local planner could not generate a feasible trajectory that safely navigated around the detected obstacle."

Here is a breakdown of the relevant events and their implications:\n\n1. **New Obstacle Detected**: \n   - \"New obstacle detected at position (-3.0, -0.5)\" implies that while executing the navigation plan, an unexpected obstacle was identified in the robot's path.\n\n2. **Path Replanning Attempts**:\n   - The robot attempted to replan the path multiple times in response to detecting the obstacle: \"Path is being replanned\". Each attempt ultimately failed: \"Failed to get a plan\".\n\n3. **Planner Infeasibility**:\n   - The error message: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" indicates that the navigation planner (in this case, TebLocalPlannerROS) determined that the proposed trajectory around the obstacle could not be executed. This could be due to:\n     - Insufficient space to navigate around the obstacle.\n     - Constraints in the robot's kinematic or dynamic capabilities.\n     - Other environmental factors (like narrow passages, irregular terrain).\n\n4. **Recovery Behaviors**:\n   - The robot executed recovery behaviors to try and clear the path, such as \"Clearing both costmaps\" and \"Rotate recovery behavior started\", which are intended to help the robot find a new feasible path.\n   - Despite these efforts, the planner continuously failed: \"Failed to get a plan\".\n\n5. **Final Abortion**:\n   - After all recovery behaviors and replanning efforts were exhausted, the navigation goal was aborted: \"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors\".\n\nIn summary, the paths were not feasible due to the new obstacle, which the robot's planner could not navigate around despite multiple replanning attempts and recovery behaviors. This resulted in the goal being aborted, and the robot failed to reach waypoint 1."

        "question": "Why were one or more of the paths not feasible?",
        "answers": "One or more paths were not feasible due to obstacles detected in the robot's path and subsequent challenges in navigation and planning. Here are specific reasons based on the log messages:\n\n1. **Obstacle Detection:**\n   - The logs indicate multiple instances of new obstacles being detected, such as at positions (1.5, -2.5), and during navigation towards waypoint 3 (\"Robot is nearing the obstacle\").\n\n2. **Path Replanning:**\n   - When the robot was nearing obstacles, the logs mention that the path was being replanned. This happened multiple times during the attempt to reach waypoint 3 (\"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned\").\n\n3. **Oscillation and Recovery:**\n   - The `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected possible oscillation, which is often an indication of a planning or execution issue where the robot or its plan is oscillating back and forth instead of making progress. The planner then activated a recovery strategy (\"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected. Activating recovery strategy\").\n\n4. **Costmap Clearing:**\n   - The robot performed multiple costmap clearing operations to remove obstacles from its navigation map. This was evident from the messages \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot\" and \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot\". Frequent need for costmap clearing indicates persistent or intermittent obstacles impacting the feasibility of the paths.\n\n5. **Failure to Reach Waypoint:**\n   - Despite replanning and costmap clearing, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 3, as indicated by the message \"Failed to reach waypoint 3\". This failure highlights that the obstacles and the resulting replanning were significant enough to prevent successful navigation to the target waypoint.\n\nOverall, the primary reason for the infeasibility of one or more paths was the presence of obstacles that complicated the navigation process, leading to repeated replanning and recovery actions that were insufficient to ensure path viability."

Path is being replanned.\" indicates that the robot initiated path replanning to find an alternative route.\n\n2. **Trajectory Reset**:\n   - The log message \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\" suggests that the robot reset its trajectory planning whenever it identified that the current trajectory was not feasible.\n\n3. **Oscillation Recovery**:\n   - The robot also engaged in an oscillation recovery strategy when possible oscillation was detected, as indicated by \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\"\n\n4. **Clearing Costmaps**:\n   - To aid in replanning and potentially eliminate oscillations or obstacles, the robot cleared both costmaps within a 3.00-meter square centered on its location, as indicated by \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\"\n\nDespite these efforts during navigation to waypoint 2, the robot ultimately failed to reach the waypoint, as indicated by \"Failed to reach waypoint 2.\" However, these strategies allowed the robot to navigate successfully to subsequent waypoints, demonstrating effective recovery and re-planning mechanisms."

        "answers": "The robot encountered an obstacle at position (3.0, 0.0) multiple times during its navigation tasks. When it detected this obstacle, it attempted to replan its path to avoid the obstruction. However, during the navigation towards waypoint 5, the robot identified that it was nearing the obstacle and triggered a path replanning. Despite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 5, indicating that the replanned path was not feasible in this instance. This suggests that the robot's routine for dealing with unfeasible paths involved obstacle detection and dynamic path replanning, though in some scenarios, the robot might still fail to successfully navigate to the goal if a viable path cannot be found."

        "answers": "The robot handled unfeasible paths using the TebLocalPlannerROS. Here's a detailed breakdown of actions taken:\n\n1. **Trajectory Infeasibility and Path Replanning**:\n   - Upon detecting an infeasible trajectory, the TebLocalPlannerROS issued a message stating \"trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\", which indicates that the current path was not viable, prompting the planner to reset and attempt to generate a new path.\n   - Simultaneously, the robot recognized it was nearing an obstacle and performed path replanning multiple times.\n\n2. **Oscillation Detection and Recovery**:\n   - The TebLocalPlannerROS also detected a possible oscillation, indicated by the message \"possible oscillation detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\" This suggests that the robot identified undesirable oscillations either in its motion or its local plan and triggered a recovery strategy to stabilize its navigation by preferring a specific turning direction.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**:\n   - At one point, the robot cleared both its costmaps outside a 3.00-meter square centered on the robot. Clearing costmaps often helps resolve navigation issues by eliminating outdated or irrelevant obstacle data, allowing for a fresh start in planning a new path.\n\nDespite these measures, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1, suggesting that the combined efforts to reset the planner, perform replanning, activate recovery strategies, and clear the costmaps were not sufficient to overcome the navigation challenges it faced."

        "answers": "When the robot encountered unfeasible paths, it performed several key actions to handle the situation:\n\n1. **Obstacle Detection**: The robot first detected a new obstacle at position (1.5, -3.5). This initial identification of the obstruction was crucial in triggering subsequent actions.\n\n2. **Path Replanning**: Upon nearing the obstacle, the robot attempted to replan its path. This involved reconsidering its route to avoid the detected obstacle.\n\n3. **TebLocalPlannerROS Resetting**: The robot's local planner, TebLocalPlannerROS, determined that the current trajectory was not feasible and thus reset the planner. This step indicates that the planner reassessed the situation and attempted to generate a new feasible trajectory.\n\n4. **Costmap Clearing**: The robot then cleared both costmaps, which are used to store information about the environment around the robot. This was done in two stages:\n   - First, clearing the costmap outside a 3.00-meter square centered on the robot.\n   - Second, clearing the costmap outside a 1.50-meter square centered on the robot.\n   \n   These actions potentially remove outdated or incorrect obstacle data to ensure a fresh and accurate plan.\n\n5. **Repeated Path Replanning**: Despite these measures, the robot failed to get a plan and had to replan again after each attempt as it neared the obstacle.\n\n6. **Failing and Retrying with a New Goal**: When all attempts to generate a viable plan to reach waypoint 1 failed, the robot set a new navigation goal (goal 2) and directed its efforts towards reaching that instead.\n\nBy performing these steps, the robot systematically assessed and adapted to the unfeasible paths, ultimately choosing alternative navigation goals to continue its mission successfully."

Path is being replanned.`). This indicates that the robot is attempting to find an alternative route to avoid the obstacle.\n\n2. **Recovery Strategies**:\n   - The `TebLocalPlannerROS` component identified that the trajectory was not feasible (`TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...`). This prompted the system to reset the planner, suggesting that it discarded the current trajectory and generated a new plan.\n   - If a possible oscillation in the robot's movement or its local plan was detected (`TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation...`), a recovery strategy was activated. In this instance, the strategy was to prefer the current turning direction during optimization to mitigate the oscillations and potentially find a more stable path.\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**:\n   - As part of the recovery procedures, the robot cleared both the global and local costmaps within a 3-meter square centered on the robot (`Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.`). This action removes temporary obstacles and previously identified hazards, allowing the planning system to reconsider the environment with a fresh perspective.\n\nDespite these attempts, the log indicates that the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 2, highlighting the complexity of the obstacle scenario and the limitations of the current replanning and recovery strategies."

Each of these attempts failed, as indicated by the repeated log entries stating \"Failed to get a plan.\"\n3. **Trajectory Feasibility Check**: The local planner (`TebLocalPlannerROS`) determined that the trajectory was not feasible, prompting the need to reset the planner.\n4. **Costmap Clearing**: The robot cleared both local and global costmaps outside a square area with a 3.00-meter side length centered on the robot. This action was likely intended to remove outdated or incorrect obstacle information that might have been causing planning errors.\n5. **Continued Path Replanning Attempt**: Despite the costmap clearing and planner reset, the robot still faced difficulties and repeated attempts to replan the path ultimately failed.\n\nDespite these strategies, the robot was unable to replan a feasible path to reach waypoint 2 and concluded with the log \"Failed to reach waypoint 2.\"\n\nIn summary, the robot used multiple replanning attempts, trajectory feasibility checks, and costmap clearing, but these actions were ultimately unsuccessful in overcoming the obstacle and reaching the designated waypoint."

        "question": "How did the robot deal with unfeasible path(s)?",
        "answers": "The logs indicate the robot attempted several strategies to deal with unfeasible paths when it encountered obstacles. Here are the steps it undertook:\n\n1. **Path Replanning**: The robot first attempted to replan its path upon detecting an obstacle. This is signaled by messages indicating that the \"Path is being replanned.\"\n\n2. **Repeated Attempts**: The robot made multiple attempts to replan the path, as shown by repeated instances of \"Failed to get a plan\" followed by \"Path is being replanned.\"\n\n3. **Costmap Clearing**: When initial replanning attempts failed, the robot executed costmap clearing operations. The robot cleared costmaps outside a square centered on its position first with a larger area (3.00m) and then with a smaller area (1.50m). This was an effort to remove potentially outdated obstacle information from its maps that might have hindered path planning.\n\n4. **Recovery Behaviors**: After costmap clearing, the robot executed \"Rotate recovery behavior\". This usually involves the robot rotating in place to localize itself better and reassess the environment, aiding in creating new feasible plans.\n\n5. **Abort on Failure**: Despite these recovery actions, the robot continued to fail in generating a valid path (\"Failed to get a plan\"). Ultimately, after exhausting all recovery behaviors without success, it aborted the attempt (\"Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors\").\n\n6. **Transition to Completion State**: Lastly, the robot transitioned from the ACTIVE state to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and then to DONE with the acknowledgment that it \"Failed to reach waypoint 3.\"\n\nThese steps outline a systematic approach involving replanning, environment re-evaluation, and recovery strategies to handle unfeasible paths."

Here are the steps the robot's system undertook to deal with unfeasible paths:\n\n1. **Replanning the Path:** When the robot neared an obstacle and the initially planned path was deemed unfeasible, the system attempted to replan the path multiple times.\n   \n2. **Clearing Costmaps:** \n   - **First Clearing:** The system cleared both the global and local costmaps outside a square with a side length of 3.00 meters centered on the robot.\n   - **Second Clearing:** The system later cleared both costmaps again, this time outside a smaller square with a side length of 1.50 meters centered on the robot. This action is likely intended to remove obstacles from the costmaps that may no longer be present, helping the planner determine a new feasible path.\n\n3. **Recovery Strategies:** At one point, the `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected a possible oscillation (repetitive, unproductive movement) either in the robot or its local planning. As part of the recovery from this oscillation, the planner activated a strategy where it preferred the current turning direction during optimization.\n\n4. **Path Resetting:** The `TebLocalPlannerROS` noted \"trajectory is not feasible\" multiple times and reset the planner to seek new solutions.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot was unable to find or execute a feasible trajectory to both waypoint 2 and waypoint 3, leading to failure in reaching these specific goals."

Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\"\n   - The robot detected possible oscillations, which suggests either the robot or the local plan was repeating small, unproductive movements.\n   - To counter this, a recovery strategy was activated, specifically preferring the current turning direction during optimization to break out of the oscillation.\n\n4. **Clearing Costmaps**:\n   - **Log Entry**: \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot.\"\n   - As part of the recovery strategy, the robot cleared its costmaps (data structures used to represent obstacles) to remove potentially stale obstacle information from around the robot within a 3-meter square area. This could help the robot find a new viable path without outdated obstacle data.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot **failed to reach waypoint 5** ultimately, as indicated by the final log entry. The sequence of steps highlights the robot's systematic approach to dealing with the presence of unfeasible paths in the navigation process."

        "answers": "The robot employed several strategies to deal with the unfeasible paths. Initially, upon detecting a new obstacle at position (1.5, -2.5) while navigating to waypoint 2, the robot identified that it was nearing the obstacle and attempted to replan its path. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the robot addressed the unfeasible paths:\n\n1. **Path Replanning**: Initially, the robot detected an obstacle and triggered a path replanning process to find an alternative route.\n\n2. **Oscillation Detection**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` identified possible oscillation, which can indicate that the robot or its local plan is unstable or ineffective. Consequently, the planner activated a recovery strategy that prioritized the current turning direction during optimization in an attempt to stabilize and find a feasible path.\n\n3. **Failed Plans**: Despite the replanning efforts, the robot failed to obtain a new viable path multiple times, as indicated by the repeated failures to get a plan.\n\n4. **Trajectory Infeasibility and Resetting Planner**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` declared the trajectory not feasible. Consequently, the planner was reset to potentially clear previous states and approaches that led to failure.\n\n5. **Clearing Costmaps**: As a resourceful strategy, the robot cleared both local and global costmaps (used for obstacle avoidance and path planning) outside a 3.00m square centered on itself. This strategy effectively removes old or stale data about obstacles that might be leading the planner astray.\n\n6. **Disabling Oscillation Recovery**: Lastly, the planner noted that oscillation recovery was disabled or expired, indicating that the specific recovery mechanism had concluded or was no longer applicable.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot ultimately failed to reach waypoint 2, as it couldn't find a feasible trajectory. This indicates persistent challenges in the environment or limitations within the planner's current configuration."

        "question": "How did the robot deal with unfeasible path(s)?",
        "answers": "Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot employed several strategies to handle unfeasible paths, particularly when it detected obstacles or faced possible oscillations:\n\n1. **Path Replanning**: The logs frequently mention that the robot was \"nearing the obstacle\" and as a response, \"Path is being replanned.\" This indicates that the robot dynamically adjusts its path to navigate around obstacles when they are detected in its current route.\n\n2. **Oscillation Recovery Strategies**: Logs such as \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation detected... Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)\" indicate that the robot detected oscillations (repeated back-and-forth motions) during its navigation. To counter this, it activated a recovery strategy that likely increases stability by preferring a consistent turning direction.\n\n3. **Clearing Costmaps**: The log entries \"Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot\" and the similar one for a 1.50m square indicate that the robot cleared the local costmaps (which represent obstacles and free space around the robot) to re-evaluate the environment and obtain a more accurate view for path planning.\n\n4. **Recovery Strategy for Oscillation Expiration**: The entry \"TebLocalPlannerROS: oscillation recovery disabled/expired\" suggests that the robot has a mechanism to disable certain recovery strategies if they are no longer effective or necessary.\n\nThese strategies combined allowed the robot to manage unfeasible paths by attempting different corrective actions, such as dynamically replanning the path, applying recovery behaviors to stabilize navigation, and ensuring a more accurate environmental perception by clearing and updating its costmaps."
