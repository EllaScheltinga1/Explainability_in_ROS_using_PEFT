When the robot encountered an unfeasible path, as illustrated by its attempt to navigate to waypoint 1, it implemented several strategies to handle the situation:

1. **Initial Attempt to Plan the Path**:
   - The robot attempted to create a plan to reach waypoint 1 but failed: "Failed to get a plan."

2. **Costmap Clearing**:
   - The robot cleared both costmaps (areas the robot uses to plan its movements) outside a square of different sizes centered on itself in an effort to remove potential obstacles and obtain a viable plan:
     - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
     - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."

3. **Recovery Behavior**:
   - The robot initiated a recovery behavior known as "rotate recovery," which attempts to rotate the robot to help it re-evaluate its surroundings and try to find a new path: "Rotate recovery behavior started."

Despite these efforts, the robot was still unable to generate a viable plan and therefore, decided to abort the mission to reach waypoint 1:
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
- "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

These steps indicate the robot's systematic approach to dealing with unfeasible paths by attempting various planning strategies and recovery behaviors before finally aborting the mission.
