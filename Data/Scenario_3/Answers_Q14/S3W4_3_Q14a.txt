When the robot encountered unfeasible paths during its navigation to waypoint 3, it employed several strategies to try and resolve the issue. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the robot's actions in dealing with the unfeasible paths:

1. **Detecting the Problem:** The robot failed to generate a feasible plan to reach waypoint 3.
   - **Log Entry:** "Failed to get a plan."

2. **Clearing Costmaps:** 
   - Initially, the robot cleared both global and local costmaps within a square region centered on the robot. This can help to remove any dynamic obstacles or erroneous costmap data that might be blocking the path.
     - **Log Entry:** "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - The robot then attempted a more aggressive clear within a smaller region.
     - **Log Entry:** "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."

3. **Recovery Behavior:** 
   - The robot initiated the rotate recovery behavior, which typically involves spinning in place to scan the surroundings and try to find a new, feasible path.
     - **Log Entry:** "Rotate recovery behavior started."

4. **Retrying Plan Generation:** 
   - After executing these recovery steps, the robot attempted to generate a plan again. Unfortunately, the plan generation still failed.
     - **Log Entry:** "Failed to get a plan."

5. **Aborting the Goal:** 
   - After exhausting all recovery behaviors and still failing to find a feasible plan, the robot aborted the navigation goal to waypoint 3.
     - **Log Entry:** "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"

6. **Logging the Failure:** 
   - The robot logged the transition to a state indicating the failure to reach the goal and acknowledged the aborting of the goal.
     - **Log Entry:** "Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-3-38.136)"
     - **Log Entry:** "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-3-38.136)"
     - **Log Entry:** "Failed to reach waypoint 3"

Following this failure, the robot proceeded to set and navigate towards the next goal (waypoint 4), indicating that it continued its mission with the subsequent targets.

Overall, the robot's approach to dealing with unfeasible paths included:
- Clearing costmaps to remove potential obstacles or erroneous data.
- Performing rotate recovery behavior to scan for a new path.
- Finally, aborting the goal after these efforts were unsuccessful.
