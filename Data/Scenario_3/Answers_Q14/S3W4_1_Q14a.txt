The robot attempted several recovery behaviors when it encountered unfeasible paths. Here's the sequence of actions it took as per the log messages:

1. **Initial Attempt:**
   - Sent goal 1 to `move_base` with coordinates \(x=-0.5, y=-2.0\).
   - Failed to get a plan.

2. **Recovery Behaviors:**
   - **Costmap Clearing:** Attempted to clear both costmaps outside a square of 3.00m and subsequently 1.50m centered on the robot.
   - **Rotate Recovery:** Engaged a rotate recovery behavior.
   - **Motion Played Successfully:** This indicates that the robot executed the rotate recovery movement successfully, although it didn't yield a valid path.

3. **Outcome:**
   - Despite performing costmap clearing and rotate recovery behaviors, the robot failed to get a valid plan.
   - It transitioned to `WAITING_FOR_RESULT` state and eventually to the `DONE` state with an abort status because it couldn't find a valid path after all recovery attempts.
   - It explicitly logged "Failed to reach waypoint 1".

These behaviors indicate that the robot has built-in recovery mechanisms, including costmap clearing and rotate recovery, which it attempts when an initial path planning effort fails. If these do not succeed, the robot aborts the goal.
