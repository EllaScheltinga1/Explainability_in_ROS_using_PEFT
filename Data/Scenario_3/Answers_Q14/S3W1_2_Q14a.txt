The robot attempted to deal with unfeasible paths using the following recovery behaviors:

1. **Costmap Clearing**: The robot first tried to clear costmaps, which are data structures used to store obstacles and navigation costs, by removing parts of the map outside of specified areas:
   - **First Clearing**: Cleared both costmaps outside a 3.00m square centered on the robot.
   - **Second Clearing**: Reduced the clearing area to a 1.50m square.

2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: After the initial attempts at clearing the costmaps didn't result in a valid plan, the robot initiated a rotate recovery behavior, which generally involves rotating the robot in place to help it re-evaluate its surroundings and potentially find a new viable path.

Despite these recovery efforts, the system still failed to generate a valid navigation plan, leading to the transition of the goal state from ACTIVE to WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and eventually to DONE with the goal being aborted because a valid path could not be found. The robot was ultimately unable to reach waypoint 1.
