The robot identified that it could not generate a valid plan to reach waypoint 1. To address this issue, it executed several recovery behaviors:

1. **Clearing Costmaps:**
   - The robot first cleared both its local and global costmaps. Costmaps are used to represent the obstacles in the robot's environment. Clearing these maps outside a 3.00m square centered on the robot and then within a 1.50m square would potentially remove any erroneous or transient obstacles that might be blocking the path.

2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior:**
   - The "rotate recovery behavior" was then initiated. This involves the robot performing a rotational movement in place to scan the environment afresh, helping it to re-evaluate its surroundings and possibly find a new feasible path.

Despite these recovery attempts, the robot was still unable to generate a valid plan. It then proceeded to abort the task, transitioning back through its state machine to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT," and ultimately to "DONE," indicating it had stopped trying to reach the waypoint and declared the mission as failed.

In summary, the robot dealt with the unfeasible path by clearing its costmaps and performing a rotate recovery behavior. When these attempts failed, it aborted the mission.
