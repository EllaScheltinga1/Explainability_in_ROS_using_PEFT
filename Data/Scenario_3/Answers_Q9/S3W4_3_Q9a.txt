Yes, obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. Specifically, while trying to reach waypoint 3 (goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-3-38.136), the robot failed to generate a valid plan on two separate occasions, even after attempting recovery behaviors such as costmap clearing and rotate recovery. The final outcome was an aborted mission as the robot could not produce a valid navigation plan. This indicates the likely presence of obstacles or an environment configuration that impeded the robot's ability to navigate to waypoint 3.
