Yes, the logs suggest that the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task to the first waypoint. The key indicators are:

1. **Failed plan attempts**:
    - "Failed to get a plan."
    - "Failed to get a plan."

2. **Recovery behaviors**:
    - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
    - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
    - "Rotate recovery behavior started."

These recovery behaviors and failed plans are typical signs that the robot was unable to find a clear path, likely due to obstacles obstructing the way. Despite these recovery attempts, the robot ultimately aborted the goal, indicating the obstacles prevented successful navigation to waypoint 1.

In contrast, the navigation to waypoint 2 was successful, with no indications of obstacles as it transitioned through states smoothly to reach the goal.
