The log messages do not explicitly mention encountering specific obstacles. However, the repeated failures to get a plan and the execution of recovery behaviors suggest that the robot might have faced navigation challenges often caused by obstacles or difficult terrain.

Key points in the log that indicate potential encounters with obstacles:
1. **Failed to get a plan**: This message implies that the robot was unable to generate a viable path to the goal.
2. **Clearing both costmaps**: This action is typically executed when the robot believes there are static or dynamic obstacles in the maps it is using, which are preventing it from finding a path.
3. **Rotate recovery behavior started**: Recovery behaviors are initiated when the robot encounters difficulties, such as obstacles, that prevent it from progressing.

The failure to reach waypoint 1 and aborting the navigation task after executing all recovery behaviors indicate that the robot could not find a path, likely due to obstacles it couldn't navigate around or through.
