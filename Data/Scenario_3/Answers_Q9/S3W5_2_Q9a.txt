Yes, there were obstacles encountered during the navigation task, specifically during the attempt to reach waypoint 5. The logs indicate that the robot failed to get a valid plan despite attempting recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and executing a rotate recovery behavior. The sequence of events leading up to the failure includes:

1. **Failed to get a plan**: Indicates an initial problem in planning a path.
2. **Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot**: A recovery attempt to clear potential obstacles or stale data in the costmap.
3. **Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot**: Another recovery attempt with a smaller area.
4. **Rotate recovery behavior started**: A common recovery behavior to try to help the robot reorient and potentially find a path.
5. **Failed to get a plan**: The second failure in planning suggests persistent obstacles or issues that could not be resolved by the recovery behaviors.
6. **Aborting because a valid plan could not be found**: The robot aborted the goal as it could not find a valid path.

These steps indicate that obstacles or conditions in the environment prevented the robot from finding a viable path to reach waypoint 5, despite multiple recovery attempts.
