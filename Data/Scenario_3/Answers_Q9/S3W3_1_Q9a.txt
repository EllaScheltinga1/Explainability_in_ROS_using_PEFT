Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot experienced difficulties in creating valid navigation plans for the first two waypoints (waypoint 1: x=-2.0, y=-2.0 and waypoint 2: x=-3.5, y=-7.0). The following log entries indicate issues with path planning:

1. **Waypoint 1**:
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
   
2. **Waypoint 2**:
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

These repetitions of "Failed to get a plan" and the use of recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and the rotate recovery behavior suggest that the robot likely encountered obstacles or difficult terrain which prevented the planner from finding a feasible path.

For **Waypoint 3** (x=2.0, y=-7.0), the logs indicate that the robot successfully reached its destination without mentioning any issues:
- "GOAL Reached!"
- "Reached waypoint 3."

Given the lack of similar path planning failures for Waypoint 3, it can be inferred that no significant obstacles were encountered during the navigation to the third waypoint, unlike the first two waypoints where obstacles or difficult paths caused failures in generating a valid plan.
