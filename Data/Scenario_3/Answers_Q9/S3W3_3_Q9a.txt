Yes, obstacles were encountered during the navigation task. 

The log indicates that the robot failed to get a plan while navigating to waypoint 1 and had to perform recovery behaviors. Specifically, the log mentions:

1. "Failed to get a plan."
2. "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
3. "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
4. "Rotate recovery behavior started."
5. "Failed to get a plan."
6. "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

Ultimately, this resulted in the failure to reach waypoint 1. The subsequent goals (waypoints 2 and 3) did not report any obstacles, as the goals were successfully reached.
