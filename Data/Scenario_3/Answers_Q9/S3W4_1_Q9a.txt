Yes, obstacles were likely encountered during the navigation task, particularly when the robot attempted to reach waypoint 1. Here are the indicators from the logs that suggest obstacles or navigation issues:

1. **Failed to get a plan**: This indicates that the robot's path planning algorithm was unable to find a valid path to the goal, which is often due to obstacles or an infeasible map state.
   
2. **Clearing costmaps**: The robot cleared costmaps multiple times, which is a common recovery behavior used to clear perceived obstacles or navigation inconsistencies in the environment.
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."

3. **Rotate recovery behavior started**: The attempt to use a recovery behavior like rotate recovery suggests that the robot was trying to reorient itself to find a feasible path around an obstacle.

4. **Aborting because a valid plan could not be found**: Eventually, the robot aborted the navigation to waypoint 1 as it couldn't find a valid path even after all recovery attempts.

These events collectively indicate that the robot faced obstacles or planning issues when attempting to navigate to waypoint 1. However, after this failure, the robot successfully reached waypoints 2, 3, and 4, indicating that it did not encounter insurmountable obstacles for those goals.
