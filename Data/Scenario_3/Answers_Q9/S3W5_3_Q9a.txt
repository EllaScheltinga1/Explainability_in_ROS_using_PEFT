Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation tasks. This is evidenced by the failures to generate a valid plan for waypoints 2 and 4. The log messages indicate the following:

1. **Waypoint 2:**
   - The log entry "Failed to get a plan." suggests that the robot's path planning algorithm could not generate a feasible path to the goal coordinates (x=2.5, y=-5.5).
   - Recovery behaviors were attempted, including clearing costmaps and a rotate recovery behavior, but these were unsuccessful.
   - The message "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors" confirms that obstacles likely prevented the creation of a viable path.

2. **Waypoint 4:**
   - Similar to waypoint 2, the log entry "Failed to get a plan." indicates an issue with path planning for the goal coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-10.5).
   - Recovery behaviors were attempted again, clearing costmaps and performing a rotate recovery behavior, but failed to resolve the issue.
   - The process ended with "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors," indicating persistent obstacles.

These obstacles resulted in the robot being unable to reach waypoints 2 and 4 despite multiple recovery attempts.
