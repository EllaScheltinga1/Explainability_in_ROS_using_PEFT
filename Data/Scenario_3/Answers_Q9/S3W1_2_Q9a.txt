The log messages suggest that the autonomous robot encountered obstacles or difficulties while trying to navigate to waypoint 1. Here are the key points indicating that:

1. **Failed to get a plan:** This message appears twice, indicating that the robot's navigation system was unable to compute a path to the target location.

2. **Clearing both costmaps:** The robot attempted to clear the local and global costmaps, which are used for obstacle avoidance and path planning. This action usually indicates that the navigation stack detected obstacles or inflated cells preventing path planning.

3. **Rotate recovery behavior started:** This action is meant to help the robot re-evaluate the environment by rotating in place to get a better sense of the surrounding area, commonly used when obstacles are suspected to be blocking the path.

4. **Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors:** Despite attempting recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotating, the robot still could not find a valid plan, strongly implying the presence of persistent obstacles or narrow navigation constraints.

Therefore, the log messages strongly indicate that obstacles were encountered during the navigation task, leading to the failure to reach waypoint 1.
