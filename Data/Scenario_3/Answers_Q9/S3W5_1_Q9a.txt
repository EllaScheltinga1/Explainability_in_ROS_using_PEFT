Yes, there were obstacles encountered during the navigation task. The log messages indicate the detection of oscillations during the navigation to waypoint 2. Here are the relevant log entries:

1. **For waypoint 2**:
   - "TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization)."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Aborting because the robot appears to be oscillating over and over. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
   
   The robot was unable to reach waypoint 2 due to repeated oscillations, and all recovery strategies were exhausted without success.

2. **For waypoint 3**:
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
   
   The robot also failed to navigate to waypoint 3, as it was unable to generate a valid plan despite multiple attempts and the execution of recovery behaviors.

These log entries suggest that the robot encountered obstacles that caused oscillations and prevented it from finding valid paths to waypoints 2 and 3.
