Yes, there were obstacles or navigation issues encountered during the attempt to reach waypoint 3. The logs indicate that the robot failed to generate a valid plan multiple times, which led to the execution of recovery behaviors such as clearing both costmaps and performing a rotate recovery. Despite these attempts, the robot was still unable to generate a valid plan and ultimately aborted the navigation task for waypoint 3. This sequence of events suggests that the robot encountered obstacles or other navigational difficulties preventing it from finding a clear path.
