The log messages do not explicitly mention encountering any physical obstacles. However, the robot's inability to develop a valid plan might imply that there could have been obstacles obstructing the intended path or other navigation issues like closed spaces. Here is a breakdown of relevant points:

1. **Failed Plan Generation**:
   - "Failed to get a plan" indicates that the robot was unable to compute a path to the goal waypoint.
   
2. **Recovery Behaviors**:
   - The robot undertook recovery behaviors such as "clearing both costmaps outside a square" and "rotate recovery behavior", which suggests it attempted to resolve potential navigation issues like obstacles or path blockages.
  
3. **Abortion of Goals**:
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors" further suggests persistent blockages or other navigation issues.

From this, we can deduce that while no direct mention of obstacles occurs, the repeated failures to generate a plan and necessities for recovery behaviors strongly imply that obstacles might have been present in the robot's environment.
