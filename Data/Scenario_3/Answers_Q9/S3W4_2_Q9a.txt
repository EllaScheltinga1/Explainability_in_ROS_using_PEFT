Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task, specifically when trying to reach waypoint 2. The ROS log indicates:

1. **Failed to Get a Plan**: The system initially failed to generate a path.
2. **TebLocalPlannerROS**: The local planner indicated that the trajectory was not feasible and reset the planner.
3. **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot attempted recovery behaviors like clearing the costmaps and rotating but still failed to plan a valid trajectory.
4. **Aborting Execution**: Ultimately, the robot aborted the navigation task for waypoint 2 after executing all recovery behaviors and still failing to find a navigable path.

These messages suggest that the robot encountered obstacles or difficult navigation conditions that it could not overcome with its planning and recovery strategies.
