Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3. The log messages detail the robot's attempts and subsequent failure to get a valid plan despite executing all recovery behaviors. This resulted in the message:
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
This series of messages eventually led to the transition:
- "Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-3-46.368)"
- "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-3-46.368)"
- "Failed to reach waypoint 3."

Thus, the robot was unable to reach waypoint 3.
