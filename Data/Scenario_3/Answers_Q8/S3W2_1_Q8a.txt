Yes, the robot failed to reach both waypoints mentioned in the logs. 

1. For waypoint 1 with coordinates (x=-1.5, y=-4.5), the logs show:
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
   - "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

2. For waypoint 2 with coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-7.0), the logs show:
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - "Failed to get a plan."
   - "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
   - "Failed to reach waypoint 2."

In both instances, the robot encountered issues in planning and was unable to navigate successfully to the designated waypoints.
