Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3. The log indicates that the robot attempted to navigate to waypoint 3 with coordinates (x=2.5, y=-8.0), but encountered issues such as failure to get a plan and unsuccessful execution of recovery behaviors. This ultimately led to the transition to the "DONE" state without reaching the goal, resulting in the log message "Failed to reach waypoint 3."
