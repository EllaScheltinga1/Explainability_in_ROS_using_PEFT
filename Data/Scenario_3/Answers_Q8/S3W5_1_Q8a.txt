Yes, the robot failed to reach two waypoints during its operation. Specifically, these were:

1. Waypoint 2: The robot encountered oscillation issues and was unable to stabilize, even after executing all recovery behaviors. This led to an abort and failure to reach waypoint 2.
2. Waypoint 3: The robot failed to generate a valid plan, even after clearing the costmaps and attempting recovery behaviors, resulting in another abort and failure to reach waypoint 3.
