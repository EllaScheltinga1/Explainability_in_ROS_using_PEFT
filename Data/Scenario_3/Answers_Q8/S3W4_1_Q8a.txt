Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. The logs indicate that initially, the robot could not get a valid plan for waypoint 1 despite attempting recovery behaviors. As a result, the robot eventually aborted the mission to waypoint 1. All subsequent waypoints (2, 3, and 4) were reached successfully.
