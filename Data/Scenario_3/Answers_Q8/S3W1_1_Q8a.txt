Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. The logs indicate that the robot initially tried to navigate to the coordinates (x=-2.5, y=1.5). Despite various actions such as attempting to retrieve a plan and executing recovery behaviors, the robot was ultimately unable to find a valid plan. The process concluded with an abort message stating that a valid plan could not be found, and it transitioned to the "DONE" state with the goal unmet, confirming the failure to reach waypoint 1.
