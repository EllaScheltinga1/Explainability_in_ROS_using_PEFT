The robot's task was to navigate to a series of waypoints. These waypoints are specified by their x and y coordinates. The log messages indicate that the robot was given sequential goals to reach specific locations (waypoints) in its environment:

1. Waypoint 1: (x=-2.0, y=0.0)
2. Waypoint 2: (x=2.5, y=-5.5)
3. Waypoint 3: (x=1.0, y=-10.0)
4. Waypoint 4: (x=-3.5, y=-10.5)
5. Waypoint 5: (x=4.0, y=-8.0)

For each waypoint, the robot attempted to navigate autonomously using the "move_base" action server. Based on the log messages, the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 3, and 5, but failed to reach waypoints 2 and 4 due to an inability to generate a valid navigation plan, even after attempting recovery behaviors.
