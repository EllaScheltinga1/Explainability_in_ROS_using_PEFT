Based on the ROS log messages, the robot's task was to navigate to specified waypoints. The log shows it attempting to reach two distinct waypoints with coordinates:

1. Waypoint 1 at x=-2.5, y=-2.0 (which the robot failed to reach)
2. Waypoint 2 at x=2.0, y=0.0 (which the robot successfully reached)

The references to "move_base action server," "Sending goal," and status transitions like "Navigating to waypoint," "ACTIVE," and "GOAL Reached!" indicate that these waypoints were part of a navigation task in which the robot had to autonomously move to specific locations.
