The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to multiple waypoints specified by x and y coordinates. The robot was engaged in an autonomous navigation mission, where it was instructed to visit various waypoints sequentially. The log messages indicate that:

1. The controllers required for navigation and sensing were started.
2. The robot attempted to navigate to the first waypoint (goal 1) at coordinates (x=2.0, y=1.0) but failed due to being unable to find a valid path.
3. The robot then switched to the second waypoint (goal 2) at coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-5.5) and successfully reached it.
4. Finally, the robot navigated to the third waypoint (goal 3) at coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-12.0) and successfully reached this one as well.

Throughout this task, the robot interacted with the `move_base` action server to set and attempt to achieve navigation goals, using built-in recovery behaviors when necessary.
