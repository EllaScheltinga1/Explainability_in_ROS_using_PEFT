The robot's task was to autonomously navigate to multiple waypoints, as indicated by the series of `move_base` goals and subsequent navigation attempts in different coordinates. Specifically, the robot was given the following goals:

1. Navigate to waypoint 1 at coordinates \( x = -2.0 \), \( y = -2.0 \).
2. Navigate to waypoint 2 at coordinates \( x = -3.5 \), \( y = -7.0 \).
3. Navigate to waypoint 3 at coordinates \( x = 2.0 \), \( y = -7.0 \).

The log indicates that the robot had difficulties in reaching the first two waypoints as it could not generate a valid plan even after recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and executing rotate recovery behavior. However, it successfully reached waypoint 3. The transitions between different states (`ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, `DONE`) further highlight the autonomous navigation process and the robot's attempts to reach the specified goals.
