The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to a specified waypoint. Specifically, the robot was instructed to move to the coordinates \( x = -2.5 \) and \( y = 1.5 \). This action was intended to be done by utilizing the `move_base` action server, which is responsible for planning and executing paths for autonomous navigation. The logs show that the robot attempted to reach this waypoint (referred to as "waypoint 1") but ultimately failed to do so.
