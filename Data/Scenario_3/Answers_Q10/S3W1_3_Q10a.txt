The robot's task was to navigate to a specific waypoint. Specifically, it was given a goal to reach the coordinate (x=2.0, y=-10.0) as part of its autonomous navigation. This task was managed through the `move_base` action server, which handles path planning and movement for navigation. The log messages indicate that the robot attempted to navigate to this waypoint, but ultimately failed to generate a valid plan to reach the destination, even after attempting recovery behaviors.
