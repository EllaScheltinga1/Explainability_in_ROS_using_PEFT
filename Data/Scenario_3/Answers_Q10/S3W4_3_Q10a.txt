The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. This is evident from the repeated process of:
1. Sending navigation goals to the `move_base` action server with specific coordinates.
2. Navigating to these waypoints.
3. Transitioning through various states (such as `ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and `DONE`).
4. Successfully reaching or failing to reach the given waypoints.

Specifically, the robot was given a set of four goals and attempted to navigate to each specified coordinate (`waypoint 1` to `waypoint 4`). The robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, and 4 but failed to reach waypoint 3.
