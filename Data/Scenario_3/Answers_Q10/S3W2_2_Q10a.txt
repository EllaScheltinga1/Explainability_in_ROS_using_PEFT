The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to multiple waypoints. Specifically, the robot was given goals to navigate to specific coordinates:

1. The first goal was to reach waypoint 1 at coordinates \( x = -2.5 \), \( y = 0.0 \).
2. The second goal was to reach waypoint 2 at coordinates \( x = -4.0 \), \( y = -5.5 \).

The robot successfully reached the first waypoint but failed to reach the second waypoint due to an inability to generate a valid navigation plan, even after executing recovery behaviors.
