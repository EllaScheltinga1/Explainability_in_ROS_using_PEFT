The robot's task was to navigate to specific waypoints autonomously. The log indicates that the robot attempted to reach two different waypoints. For waypoint 1, the goal coordinates were x=-1.5, y=-4.5, and for waypoint 2, the goal coordinates were x=-3.5, y=-7.0. The robot was required to use the navigation system ("move_base") to travel to these coordinates. 

However, the robot encountered difficulties in creating a valid plan to reach these waypoints, even after executing recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotating. Consequently, it failed to reach both designated waypoints.
