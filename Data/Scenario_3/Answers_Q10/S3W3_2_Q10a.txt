The robot's task was autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. Specifically, it needed to move sequentially to the predefined coordinates (waypoints) given as goals to the `move_base` action server.

1. **Waypoint 1**: The robot successfully moved to coordinates \( x=1.5 \), \( y=-3.0 \).
2. **Waypoint 2**: The robot successfully moved to coordinates \( x=4.0 \), \( y=-7.0 \).
3. **Waypoint 3**: The robot attempted to move to coordinates \( x=2.0 \), \( y=-10.0 \) but failed due to unsuccessful planning and recovery attempts.

The robot's logs indicate transitions through various states such as `ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and `DONE`, tracking its progress and completion status for each goal. The failure at Waypoint 3 included recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotate recovery, but a valid plan could not be determined to reach the final waypoint.
