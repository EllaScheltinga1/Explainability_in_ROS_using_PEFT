Based on the ROS log messages provided, the robot did not successfully reach any waypoint. The logs indicate that the robot was attempting to navigate to waypoint 1 with coordinates x=-0.5, y=-2.0 but failed to generate a valid plan and could not successfully reach the waypoint. The final log entries state that the robot aborted the mission because a valid plan could not be found, even after executing all recovery behaviors. Therefore, the last waypoint reached by the robot was none.
