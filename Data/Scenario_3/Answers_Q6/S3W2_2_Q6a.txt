The last waypoint the robot reached was waypoint 1. The log contains the following messages:

- "GOAL Reached!"
- "Reached waypoint 1"

This indicates that the robot successfully navigated and reached waypoint 1. The attempt to navigate to waypoint 2 failed:

- "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-4.0, y=-5.5"
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found..."
- "Failed to reach waypoint 2\."

Therefore, waypoint 1 is the last waypoint the robot successfully reached.
