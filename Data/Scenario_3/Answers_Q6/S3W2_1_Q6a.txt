Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot did not successfully reach any of the waypoints mentioned. It attempted to navigate to two waypoints:

1. Waypoint 1 with coordinates x=-1.5, y=-4.5
2. Waypoint 2 with coordinates x=-3.5, y=-7.0

In both cases, the robot failed to get a valid plan and was unable to reach the respective waypoints even after executing recovery behaviors. Therefore, the last waypoint the robot was attempting to reach was waypoint 2, but it did not successfully reach it.
