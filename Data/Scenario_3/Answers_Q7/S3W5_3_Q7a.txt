No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically:

1. Waypoint 1 (x=-2.0, y=0.0): Successfully reached.
2. Waypoint 2 (x=2.5, y=-5.5): Failed to get a plan, even after executing recovery behaviors.
3. Waypoint 3 (x=1.0, y=-10.0): Successfully reached.
4. Waypoint 4 (x=-3.5, y=-10.5): Failed to get a plan, even after executing recovery behaviors.
5. Waypoint 5 (x=4.0, y=-8.0): Successfully reached.

Thus, out of the five waypoints, the robot failed to reach waypoints 2 and 4 due to the inability to generate a valid plan.
