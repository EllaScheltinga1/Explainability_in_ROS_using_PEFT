No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log shows multiple instances where the system failed to get a plan. Despite attempting recovery behaviors like clearing the costmaps and using rotate recovery behavior, the robot was still unable to find a valid plan. Ultimately, this led to aborting the mission with the message "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors," and the log ends with "Failed to reach waypoint 1." This indicates that the planned paths during the navigation task were not feasible.
