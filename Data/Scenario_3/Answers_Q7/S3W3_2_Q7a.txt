No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached the first two waypoints but failed to reach the third waypoint. The log indicates that the robot encountered issues in generating a valid path for waypoint 3, even after executing all available recovery behaviors, leading to the task being aborted:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=1.5, y=-3.0)**: Successfully navigated and goal reached.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=4.0, y=-7.0)**: Successfully navigated and goal reached.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=2.0, y=-10.0)**: Failed to navigate as it could not get a plan even after retries and recovery actions were attempted.

Thus, only the paths for waypoints 1 and 2 were feasible, while the path for waypoint 3 was not.
