No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2. Despite attempting recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and initiating rotate recovery, the robot was unable to generate a valid plan to reach the second waypoint. This led to the navigation system aborting the attempt and transitioning to a "DONE" state without successfully reaching waypoint 2.
