No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot was able to successfully reach waypoint 1, waypoint 4, and waypoint 5. However, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2 and waypoint 3:

1. **Waypoint 2:** The robot encountered oscillation issues and despite executing all recovery strategies, it could not proceed and had to abort the goal.
2. **Waypoint 3:** The robot failed to find a valid plan even after multiple recovery attempts and had to abort the goal. 

Therefore, only three out of the five waypoints were successfully navigated to, indicating that not all planned paths were feasible.
