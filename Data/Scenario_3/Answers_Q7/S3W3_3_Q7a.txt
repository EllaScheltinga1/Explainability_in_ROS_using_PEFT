No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot encountered difficulties with the first goal (waypoint 1, coordinates x=2.0, y=1.0). Despite several attempts, including clearing the costmaps and performing recovery behaviors, the robot failed to get a valid plan and ultimately aborted the mission for waypoint 1. However, the robot successfully reached waypoint 2 (coordinates x=-3.0, y=-5.5) and waypoint 3 (coordinates x=-3.5, y=-12.0). Thus, only the first planned path was not feasible.
