No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:
1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-0.5, y=-2.0):** The robot failed to get a valid navigation plan and transition to the DONE state after executing all recovery behaviors. The log explicitly states, "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=-7.0):** The goal was successfully reached.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=0.0, y=-8.0):** The goal was successfully reached.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-3.5, y=-8.5):** The goal was successfully reached.

Thus, out of the four waypoints, only the path to waypoint 1 was infeasible, while the paths to waypoints 2, 3, and 4 were feasible and successfully navigated.
