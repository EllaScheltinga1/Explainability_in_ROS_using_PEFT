No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically:

1. **Waypoint 1**: The path was feasible, and the goal was reached successfully.
2. **Waypoint 2**: The path was **not** feasible. The robot failed to get a plan and executed recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotating, but even after these efforts, it could not find a valid plan and had to abort the attempt.
3. **Waypoint 3**: Initially, the trajectory was not feasible, prompting the planner to reset. However, the robot eventually succeeded in reaching the goal after the reset.
4. **Waypoint 4**: The path was feasible, and the goal was reached successfully.

Thus, out of the four waypoints, the path to Waypoint 2 was not feasible.
