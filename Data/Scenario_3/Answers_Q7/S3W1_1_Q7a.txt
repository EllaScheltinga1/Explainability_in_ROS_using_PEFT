No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate multiple failures in generating a valid plan, as seen in the messages "Failed to get a plan" and "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors." Despite attempts at recovery, such as clearing costmaps and initiating rotate recovery behavior, the robot was unable to find a feasible path and ultimately failed to reach waypoint 1.
