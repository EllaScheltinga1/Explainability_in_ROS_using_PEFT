No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, and 4. However, it failed to reach waypoint 3. Specifically, the log messages indicate a failure to get a plan for waypoint 3, despite attempts with recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and using rotate recovery behavior. Ultimately, the robot aborted the attempt to reach waypoint 3 because a valid plan could not be found.
