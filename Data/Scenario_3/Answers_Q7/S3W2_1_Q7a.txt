No, none of the planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate that the robot attempted to reach two different waypoints (coordinates: x=-1.5, y=-4.5 for waypoint 1 and x=-3.5, y=-7.0 for waypoint 2), but it failed to generate a valid plan for both waypoints. Despite clearing the costmaps and executing recovery behaviors, the robot could not find a feasible path and subsequently aborted both attempts.
