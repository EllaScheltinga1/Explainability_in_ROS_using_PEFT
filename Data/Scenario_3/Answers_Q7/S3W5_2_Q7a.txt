Not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully navigated to waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 4 as indicated by the log messages showing that the goals were reached and the transitions to 'DONE' state were completed for these waypoints. However, the robot failed to reach waypoint 5. 

The log indicates several errors for waypoint 5:
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
- "Rotate recovery behavior started."
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

Finally, the log states "Failed to reach waypoint 5", which confirms that the path to waypoint 5 was not feasible.
