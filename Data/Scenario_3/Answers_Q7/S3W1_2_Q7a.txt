No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate multiple attempts to generate a plan which failed:

1. "Failed to get a plan."
2. "Failed to get a plan."

Despite efforts to clear costmaps and initiate recovery behavior (e.g., rotating recovery behavior), the robot could not find a valid path. Consequently, the task was aborted with the message, "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors," and the final log entry confirmed, "Failed to reach waypoint 1." These messages collectively show that the robot was unable to find a feasible path to its goal.
