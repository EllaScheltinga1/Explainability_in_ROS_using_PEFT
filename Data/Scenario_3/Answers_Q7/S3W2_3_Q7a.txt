No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot's attempt to navigate to waypoint 1 (x=-2.5, y=-2.0) failed because it could not generate a valid plan, even after executing all available recovery behaviors. As a result, it had to abort the attempt to reach waypoint 1. However, the robot successfully reached waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=0.0), indicating that the planned path for this waypoint was feasible.
