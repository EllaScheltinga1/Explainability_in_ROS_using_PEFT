No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot was able to reach waypoint 1, waypoint 3, and waypoint 4 successfully, but it failed to reach waypoint 2. 

Here's a summary of the waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1: x=-4.0, y=-2.0**
   - Status: **Reached** (Goal achieved)
   
2. **Waypoint 2: x=0.0, y=-2.0**
   - Status: **Failed to reach**
     - Issues faced: 
       - "Failed to get a plan."
       - "TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner..."
       - Recovery behaviors executed without success
       - Ultimately: "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
   
3. **Waypoint 3: x=-3.0, y=-5.5**
   - Status: **Reached** (Goal achieved)

4. **Waypoint 4: x=2.0, y=-7.0**
   - Status: **Reached** (Goal achieved)

So out of the four waypoints, three were successfully reached, and one failed due to planning and trajectory feasibility issues.
