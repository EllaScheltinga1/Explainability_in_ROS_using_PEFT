No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. Based on the ROS log messages, the robot received and navigated towards two waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1** (x=-2.5, y=-2.0)
   - The robot attempted to reach this waypoint but failed. It went through several states and recovery behaviors but ultimately aborted the mission because a valid plan could not be found. The logs confirm: "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

2. **Waypoint 2** (x=2.0, y=0.0)
   - The robot successfully reached this waypoint. The logs indicate: "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 2."

In summary, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1 but successfully reached waypoint 2.
