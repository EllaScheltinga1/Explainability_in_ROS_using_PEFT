No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot attempted to reach three waypoints:

1. Waypoint 1 at coordinates (x=-2.0, y=-2.0) was not reached due to failure in planning even after executing all recovery behaviors.
2. Waypoint 2 at coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-7.0) was not reached for the same reason as waypoint 1.
3. Waypoint 3 at coordinates (x=2.0, y=-7.0) was successfully reached.

Thus, out of the three waypoints, only the third waypoint was successfully reached by the robot.
