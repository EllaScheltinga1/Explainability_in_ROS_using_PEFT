No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot had four waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=2.0, y=-2.0)**: Successfully reached.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=3.0, y=-7.0)**: Successfully reached.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=2.5, y=-8.0)**: Failed to reach.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=3.5, y=-11.0)**: Successfully reached.

Hence, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3 due to an inability to generate a valid plan even after attempting recovery behaviors.
