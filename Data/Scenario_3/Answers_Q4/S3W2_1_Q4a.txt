No, neither of the received waypoints was successfully reached. The log reveals that the robot failed to reach both waypoint 1 (x=-1.5, y=-4.5) and waypoint 2 (x=-3.5, y=-7.0). For each waypoint, the robot was unable to generate a valid plan even after executing all recovery behaviors, leading to the abortion of the attempts and transitions to the DONE state.
