No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. Specifically, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. The log messages show the following timeline:

- The robot received a goal and attempted to navigate to waypoint 1 with coordinates `x=-0.5` and `y=-2.0`.
- It transitioned to ACTIVE status but then failed to get a plan.
- The robot attempted various recovery behaviors, including clearing costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior.
- Despite these efforts, it failed to get a valid plan and ultimately aborted the mission for waypoint 1, transitioning to the DONE state.

Thus, waypoint 1 was not successfully reached.
