No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log indicates that the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. Despite attempts to navigate and execute recovery behaviors, the robot could not generate a valid plan to reach the destination and ultimately aborted the task. This conclusion is drawn from the lines: 
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
- "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
