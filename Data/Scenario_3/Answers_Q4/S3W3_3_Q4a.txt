No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached.

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=2.0, y=1.0)**:
   - The robot attempted to navigate to waypoint 1.
   - Multiple failures occurred in planning a path.
   - Recovery behaviors (clearing costmaps and rotation) were attempted but failed.
   - The process was aborted due to the inability to find a valid plan.
   - **Result**: Failed to reach waypoint 1.

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-3.0, y=-5.5)**:
   - The robot successfully navigated to waypoint 2.
   - **Result**: Successfully reached waypoint 2.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-3.5, y=-12.0)**:
   - The robot successfully navigated to waypoint 3.
   - **Result**: Successfully reached waypoint 3.
