No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. According to the log messages:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-2.5, y=0.0)**: The robot successfully reached this waypoint. This is indicated by the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 1."

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-4.0, y=-5.5)**: The robot failed to reach this waypoint. This is confirmed by the messages indicating repeated planning failures ("Failed to get a plan" and "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors.") followed by "Failed to reach waypoint 2."

Thus, the robot successfully reached only the first waypoint and failed to reach the second.
