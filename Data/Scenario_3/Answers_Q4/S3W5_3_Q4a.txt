No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-2.0, y=0.0):** Successfully reached.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=2.5, y=-5.5):** Failed to reach due to inability to get a valid plan even after recovery behaviors.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=1.0, y=-10.0):** Successfully reached.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-3.5, y=-10.5):** Failed to reach due to inability to get a valid plan even after recovery behaviors.
5. **Waypoint 5 (x=4.0, y=-8.0):** Successfully reached.

So, out of the five received waypoints, only three were successfully reached, while two (waypoints 2 and 4) were not reached.
