The robot did not successfully reach any waypoint. It attempted to navigate to the first waypoint, which was specified with coordinates x=2.0, y=-10.0, but failed to do so. The log messages indicate that after several attempts, including clearing costmaps and initiating recovery behaviors, the robot was unable to generate a valid plan and ultimately aborted the mission. Thus, the robot did not reach waypoint 1.
