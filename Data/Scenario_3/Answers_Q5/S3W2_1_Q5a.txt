The robot did not successfully reach any of the waypoints. The log messages indicate that for the first waypoint (x=-1.5, y=-4.5), the robot failed to get a plan and ultimately aborted the attempt after executing recovery behaviors. Similarly, for the second waypoint (x=-3.5, y=-7.0), the robot again failed to obtain a valid plan and aborted the attempt. Therefore, the robot did not reach the first waypoint or any other waypoint.
