The log messages provide several indications as to why the robot failed to find feasible paths to certain waypoints:

1. **Costmap Clearing Attempts**: For both waypoints 1 and 2, the robot attempted to clear the costmaps outside squares of varying sizes (3.00m and 1.50m) centered on itself. This is a common practice to handle potentially stale or incorrect obstacle data. The repeated clearing suggests that the robot encountered obstacles or environmental data that it couldn't navigate around.

2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: The logs indicate that the "rotate recovery behavior" was initiated during attempts to reach both waypoints 1 and 2. This behavior typically tries to re-orient the robot to escape from difficult or stuck scenarios, indicating that the robot was having significant trouble in those areas.

3. **Failed to Get a Plan**: On multiple occasions, the log states "Failed to get a plan." This shows that the path planning algorithms (likely using A* or Dijkstra's algorithm) were unable to generate a viable path given the current map and sensor data, reinforcing that there may have been either insurmountable obstacles, incorrect map data, or dynamic changes in the environment making path planning infeasible.

4. **Final Abort Decision**: After executing all available recovery behaviors, the system still failed to obtain a valid plan, leading to the decisions to abort. This corroborates the likelihood of complex, unresolvable environmental conditions or data inconsistencies.

The successful navigation to waypoint 3 implies that the area en route to this waypoint was less complicated, allowing the planning algorithms to generate a feasible path.

In summary, the infeasibility of paths to waypoints 1 and 2 is due to the presence of obstacles, potentially out-of-date or erroneous map data, or dynamic environmental changes which the robot's recovery behaviors were unable to handle.
