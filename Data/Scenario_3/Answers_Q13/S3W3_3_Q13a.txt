The log message "Failed to get a plan" indicates that the robot's planning algorithm could not generate a feasible path to the first waypoint (x=2.0, y=1.0). There are several potential reasons why the planning algorithm might have failed:

1. **Environmental Obstacles**: The area might have been obstructed by dynamic or static objects, making it impossible to find a collision-free path.
2. **Costmap Issues**: The local or global costmaps may have been overly inflated, improperly configured, or contained stale data that misrepresented the environment.
3. **Insufficient Map Data**: The robotâ€™s map data might not have been comprehensive enough to cover the area around the first waypoint, leading to planning failures.
4. **Navigation Configuration**: The navigation parameters, such as allowable obstacle clearance, maximum planning attempts, and allowable path cost, might not have been appropriately tuned.
5. **Sensor Errors**: Faulty sensor data (e.g., from the IMU or force-torque sensors) could have led to incorrect perceptions of the environment, causing planning to fail.

The robot attempted recovery behaviors, such as clearing the costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior, but these efforts were unsuccessful in resolving the issue. Consequently, the navigation system aborted the goal as it could not compute a valid plan despite these recovery attempts.

The successful attainment of goals 2 and 3 implies that the planning algorithm and navigation stack were capable of functioning correctly under different conditions or locations, highlighting that the issue was likely specific to the environment or constraints around waypoint 1.
