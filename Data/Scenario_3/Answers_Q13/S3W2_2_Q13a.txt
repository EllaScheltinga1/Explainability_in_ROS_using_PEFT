The log messages indicate that the robot failed to reach waypoint 2 due to its inability to generate a valid navigation plan. Here is a detailed explanation based on the messages:

1. **Initial Attempt and Failure to Plan**: 
   - The robot received the goal to move to waypoint 2 at coordinates `x=-4.0, y=-5.5`.
   - A failure was immediately encountered: `Failed to get a plan`.

2. **Recovery Behaviors Initiated**:
   - To address the failed planning attempt, the system initiated recovery behaviors to clear obstacles or re-evaluate the environment.
   - The first recovery action was to clear both costmaps (the internal maps used for path planning and obstacle avoidance) outside a square centered on the robot, starting with a 3.00m square, and then a 1.50m square.

3. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**:
   - The system also attempted a rotate recovery behavior, which involves the robot rotating in place to reassess its surroundings.

4. **Repeated Failure**:
   - Despite these recovery actions, the log notes another failure: `Failed to get a plan`.

5. **Abortion of Goal**:
   - After exhausting the recovery behaviors, the system aborted the goal with the message: `Aborting because a valid plan could not be found`.

In summary, the paths to waypoint 2 were not feasible because the robot's path planner could not generate a valid path, even after executing multiple recovery behaviors such as costmap clearing and rotation. This indicates that there could have been significant obstacles or environmental constraints in the area surrounding waypoint 2 that the robot could not navigate around or through.
