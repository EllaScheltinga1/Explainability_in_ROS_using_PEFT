The ROS log messages indicate that the robot encountered issues with navigating to waypoint 1, resulting in the path being deemed not feasible. Here are the key reasons for the infeasibility:

1. **Failed to Get a Plan**: The log explicitly mentions "Failed to get a plan," which is indicative of the navigation system being unable to find a valid path from the robot's current position to the designated waypoint (x=-2.5, y=-2.0).

2. **Costmap Clearing Procedures**: The robot attempted to clear its costmapsâ€”first in a larger square (3.00m) and then in a smaller square (1.50m) centered on the robot. This suggests that the initial costmap might have contained obstacles or invalid data affecting path planning. Despite these attempts to update the local environment data and remove potential obstacles, the planning still failed.

3. **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot executed a "rotate recovery behavior," which is a common procedure to reorient and attempt to find a valid path after initial failures. Even with this recovery behavior, the log indicates another failure to get a plan, leading to the final decision that the waypoint was unreachable.

These factors cumulatively indicate that obstacles or environment constraints hindered the robot's ability to find a viable route to waypoint 1, causing the path planning to fail despite multiple recovery attempts. In contrast, the path to waypoint 2 was feasible, as indicated by the successful goal achievement without reported obstacles or planning failures.
