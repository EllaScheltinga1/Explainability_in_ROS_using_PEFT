The log messages indicate that the robot experienced path planning issues for waypoint 2 with the following key points:

1. **Failed to Get a Plan**:
   - The log mentions "Failed to get a plan," indicating that the path planner was unable to generate a feasible path to the goal \( x=0.0, y=-2.0 \).

2. **TebLocalPlannerROS: Trajectory is not feasible**:
   - The error message from `TebLocalPlannerROS` states that the trajectory was not feasible. This is a common issue in path planning, potentially due to map obstacles, configuration space restrictions, or dynamic changes in the environment.

3. **Recovery Behaviors**:
   - Recovery behaviors such as "Clearing both costmaps" and "Rotate recovery behavior" were initiated to address the planning failure. These actions usually clear obstacles or help the robot reorient itself to find an alternative path.

4. **Final Outcome**:
   - Despite executing all recovery behaviors, the planner still couldn't find a valid plan: "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found."

The non-feasibility of the path could arise from several factors:
- **Obstacles**: Static or dynamic obstacles in the robot's path that the planner could not navigate around.
- **Costmap Issues**: The local or global costmaps might contain incorrect or outdated obstacle information, making planning difficult.
- **Configuration Space**: The waypoint might be in a part of the environment that's confined or has narrow passages that the robot can't navigate.
- **Planner Limitations**: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` might have limitations under certain conditions that were met at waypoint 2.

Addressing this issue might involve reviewing the environment's obstacle configuration, ensuring the costmaps are up-to-date, and potentially tuning the plannerâ€™s parameters for better feasibility.
