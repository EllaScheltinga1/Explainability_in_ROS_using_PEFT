Based on the provided ROS logs, the robot encountered issues with reaching waypoint 3 (x=2.5, y=-8.0). Here are the key details explaining why the path to waypoint 3 was not feasible:

1. **Failed to get a plan**: The robot's navigation stack could not generate a path from its current location to the goal at waypoint 3. This can happen due to a plethora of reasons such as obstacles, configuration issues, etc.

2. **Clearing costmaps**: To attempt to resolve the planning issue, the robot performed costmap clearing actions:
   - The costmaps were cleared outside a 3.00m square centered on the robot.
   - The costmaps were again cleared outside a 1.50m square centered on the robot. Costmaps are representations of the environment which include obstacles and space. Clearing them helps in recalculating a potential new path by removing potentially outdated or erroneous data.

3. **Recovery behaviors**: The robot executed a "Rotate recovery behavior" which is a common method to try and get unstuck by rotating to scan the environment for a feasible path.

4. **Persistent failure**: Despite these recovery attempts, the robot again failed to generate a valid plan and eventually aborted the task.

5. **Aborting due to no valid plan**: The repeated failures to generate a valid path and the unsuccessful execution of recovery behaviors led to the final decision to abort the planning attempt.

In summary, the reason for the infeasibility of the path to waypoint 3 was the navigation stack's inability to generate a valid path due to potential obstacles or other environmental factors, despite attempting costmap clearing and recovery behaviors.
