The log messages indicate that the autonomous robot encountered difficulties in finding viable paths to navigate towards the waypoint. Here are the key reasons for the infeasibility of the paths:

1. **Failure to Get a Plan**:
   - The first indication of a problem is the log entry: "Failed to get a plan." This suggests that the path planning algorithm could not generate a valid trajectory from the robot's current position to the goal coordinates (x=-0.5, y=-2.0).

2. **Clearing Costmaps**:
   - The robot attempted to clear the costmaps twice, first with a square 3.00 meters and then 1.50 meters centered on the robot. Clearing the costmaps is typically a recovery behavior to eliminate potential obstacles from the map that might not exist or to deal with transient issues like sensor noise.

3. **Recovery Behaviors**:
   - Despite the costmaps being cleared, the robot still failed to generate a plan. The log mentions the initiation of a "Rotate recovery behavior," which is another attempt to recover from planning failures by rotating the robot to scan for viable paths.

4. **Final Plan Failure**:
   - After executing all recovery behaviors, the log concludes with "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors". This definitively shows that every attempt to find a valid path—through replanning and recovery behaviors—was unsuccessful.

5. **Environmental Constraints**:
   - The repeated failure to generate a plan and the eventual need to abort suggest there could be significant environmental constraints that the robot’s sensors and algorithms deemed impassable. These could include obstacles, narrow passages, or other navigation hazards that the robot's system could not find a way around.

In summary, the paths were not feasible mainly due to the robot's inability to generate a valid plan, even after multiple attempts at recovery, likely due to insurmountable obstacles or challenging environment features in the robot's immediate vicinity.
