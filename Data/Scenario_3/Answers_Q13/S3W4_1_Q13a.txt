From the ROS log messages, we can discern the following progression and issues related to path feasibility:

1. **Initial Attempt to Reach Waypoint 1**:
    - The robot's move_base action server struggled to generate a plan: "Failed to get a plan."
    - Recovery behaviors like clearing costmaps and rotate recovery were attempted: 
        - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
        - "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
        - "Rotate recovery behavior started."
    - Despite these recovery efforts, the log indicates continued failure to generate a valid plan: "Failed to get a plan."
    - Ultimately, it was decided to abort the attempt: "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

Root causes for the infeasibility could include:
- **Obstacles**: Physical obstacles or perceived obstacles due to sensor noise might have made it hard to find a clear path.
- **Costmap Configuration**: Incorrect or overly conservative costmap settings might have rendered paths impassable.
- **Localization Issues**: If the robot had trouble accurately determining its position (due to sensor errors or environment characteristics), planning might have failed.

2. **Subsequent Successful Attempts (Waypoints 2, 3, and 4)**:
    - For these waypoints, valid plans were generated, and the robot successfully navigated to the goals:
        - "GOAL Reached!" for each waypoint.
        - Each attempt transitioned smoothly through the states from ACTIVE to DONE, signifying successful navigation: 
            - "Transitioning to ACTIVE... GOAL Reached!... Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT... Transitioning to DONE..."

The successful planning and navigation to waypoints 2, 3, and 4 indicate that the issues encountered at waypoint 1 were likely specific to those coordinates and conditions. Environmental factors or transient issues at waypoint 1's specific location played a significant role in the infeasibility of the path.
