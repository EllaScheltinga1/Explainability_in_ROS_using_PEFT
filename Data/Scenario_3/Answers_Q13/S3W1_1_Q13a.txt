Based on the provided ROS log messages, the autonomous robot's navigation system failed to reach waypoint 1 for several reasons:

1. **Failed Path Planning**: 
   - The log messages indicate that the robot initially failed to generate a plan (`Failed to get a plan`).
   - Despite executing recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior, the robot continued to fail to generate a valid plan (`Failed to get a plan`).

2. **Costmap Issues**: 
   - Two attempts were made to clear both costmaps: one within a 3.00m square centered on the robot and another within a 1.50m square. 
   - These steps are typically taken to remove potential local obstacles or sensor noise that might impede planning.

3. **Recovery Behaviors**:
   - The robot initiated a rotate recovery behavior, which is a common method to reorient and potentially find a different path.
   - Despite these attempts, the problem persisted, meaning that the obstacles, environment constraints, or other factors remained unresolved.

4. **Result of Recovery Attempts**:
   - Even after these recovery behaviors were executed, the robot still failed to find a valid plan. Hence, the attempt was aborted (`Aborting because a valid plan could not be found, even after executing all recovery behaviors`).

In summary, the robot's paths were not feasible due to persistent planning failures, likely caused by obstructed or complex terrain that couldn't be resolved through recovery strategies. This led to an inability to generate a valid path to the desired waypoint.
