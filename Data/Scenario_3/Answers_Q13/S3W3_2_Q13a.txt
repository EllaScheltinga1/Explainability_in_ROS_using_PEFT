The log indicates that the robot failed to reach waypoint 3 due to an inability to generate a feasible plan. The process is outlined as follows:

1. **Start of Navigation to Waypoint 3:**
   - The robot started navigating toward waypoint 3 with coordinates \(x=2.0, y=-10.0\).
   - The action server transitioned to an ACTIVE state from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, indicating it acknowledged the navigation goal.

2. **Failure to Generate a Plan:**
   - The robot encountered issues in generating a navigation plan. The log explicitly states "Failed to get a plan."

3. **Recovery Attempts:**
   - The robot attempted recovery behaviors to overcome the planning failure. Two specific actions were executed:
     - **Clearing Costmaps:** The robot first cleared the costmaps (which are used to store information about obstacles and free space) in a larger region (3.00m) and then in a smaller region (1.50m) centered on the robot. Clearing the costmaps is a common recovery behavior to remove potential spurious obstacles or outdated information.
     - **Rotate Recovery:** This behavior involves rotating the robot to help it reorient and gather new sensor data for better planning.
   
4. **Final Failure:**
   - Despite the recovery attempts, the robot still failed to generate a valid plan. The log states, "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

5. **Transitioning to DONE:**
   - The system transitioned to the DONE state from ACTIVE without achieving the goal, concluding the attempt to reach waypoint 3 as unsuccessful.

### Possible Reasons for Infeasibility:
- **Obstacles or Complex Terrain:** There may have been obstacles or complex terrain features that the robot's planner could not navigate around.
- **Sensor Data Issues:** Possible inaccuracies or outdated sensor data could have led to incorrect mapping of the environment, causing the planner to fail.
- **Configuration or Limitations of the Planner:** The planner's configuration settings or inherent limitations may have prevented it from finding a valid path.

In conclusion, the paths were not feasible primarily because the robot's planner was unable to find a valid navigation plan to waypoint 3, even after executing standard recovery behaviors.
