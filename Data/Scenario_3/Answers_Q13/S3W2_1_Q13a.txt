The logs indicate that the robot attempted to navigate to two waypoints but failed to generate feasible paths. Here are the probable reasons for the failed path planning:

1. **Failed to Get a Plan:**
   - Several instances of "Failed to get a plan" indicate that the path planning algorithms were unable to find a valid path to the target waypoints. This can occur due to various reasons, such as inadequate or blocked paths, obstacles in the environment, or map inconsistencies.

2. **Recovery Behaviors:**
   - The logs show multiple attempts to clear the costmaps and perform rotate recovery behavior. Specifically:
     - **Clearing Costmaps:** The system tried to clear potential obstacles around the robot by clearing out larger (3.00m) and smaller (1.50m) squared areas centered on the robot.
     - **Rotate Recovery:** This behavior involves rotating in place to help the sensors get a better view of the surroundings and potentially find an obstacle-free path.
   - Despite these efforts, the planner still failed to find a viable path, indicating that the issues could not be resolved with these recovery methods.

3. **Environmental Factors:**
   - Obstacles too close to the robot or throughout the planned path could have impeded successful pathfinding.
   - There might have been dynamic or static obstacles that weren't accounted for in the robot's map or were too challenging for the planner to navigate around.

4. **Map or Localization Issues:**
   - If the robot's map was inaccurate, outdated, or the robot's localization was off, the path planner could struggle to create a correct trajectory.
   - Sensor malfunctions or inaccuracies could lead to erroneous obstacle detection or misplacement in the map.

5. **Insufficient Parameter Adjustments:**
   - Parameters governing the costmap clearing or the planner's algorithm might have been insufficient for the complexity of the environment.
   - Parameters like the size of the cleared area or the duration of rotate behavior could have been inadequate, preventing the creation of a valid path.

In summary, the paths were not feasible due to the planner's inability to generate a valid path despite attempts to clear costmaps and perform recovery behaviors. This likely stems from environmental obstacles, map or localization errors, or insufficient parameter settings.
