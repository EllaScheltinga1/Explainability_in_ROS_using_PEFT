Based on the ROS log messages provided, there are several instances where the robot was unable to reach certain waypoints. The reasons for the infeasibility of the paths can be inferred from the logs:

1. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 2**:
    - **Oscillation Detected**: The log indicates that a possible oscillation of the robot or its local plan was detected by `TebLocalPlannerROS`. Oscillation often implies that the robot is struggling to decide on a clear path or is repeatedly trying to move back and forth without making progress.
    - **Recovery Behaviors**: The robot attempted recovery strategies, including clearing costmaps (removing obstacles and updating the map) and executing a rotate recovery behavior. However, these efforts were unsuccessful.
    - **Aborting Due to Persistent Oscillation**: Ultimately, the robot aborted the attempt because it kept oscillating despite executing all recovery behaviors.

2. **Failed Navigation to Waypoint 3**:
    - **Failed to Get a Plan**: The log explicitly states that the robot failed to get a valid navigation plan. This likely indicates that the global planner could not find a feasible path from the robot’s current location to the waypoint, possibly due to obstacles, narrow passages, or unreachable areas.
    - **Recovery Behaviors Again Unsuccessful**: Similar to Waypoint 2, the robot tried clearing costmaps and performing rotate recovery behavior but couldn’t make any progress.
    - **Aborting Due to Invalid Plan**: After multiple attempts, the system aborted the navigation effort as a valid plan could not be found even after executing recovery strategies.

In both failed cases, the infeasibility of the paths can be attributed to:
- **Oscillations and Local Planning Failures**: The robot got stuck in a loop trying to resolve its local path, which prevented it from moving toward the goal smoothly.
- **Inability to Generate a Valid Plan**: For Waypoint 3 specifically, the global planner was unable to find any feasible path, suggesting the area may be inaccessible or too complex for the robot to navigate given its current configuration and sensor data.

In contrast, the successful navigations (Waypoints 1, 4, and 5) did not encounter these issues, indicating relatively clear and navigable paths to those targets.
