The log messages indicate that the robot received a total of four waypoints. The details of these waypoints are as follows:

1. **Waypoint 1:** x = -0.5, y = -2.0
2. **Waypoint 2:** x = 2.0, y = -7.0
3. **Waypoint 3:** x = 0.0, y = -8.0
4. **Waypoint 4:** x = -3.5, y = -8.5

Each of these waypoints is associated with a "Sending goal" message, followed by navigation and status transitions indicating the robot's attempt to reach each designated position.
