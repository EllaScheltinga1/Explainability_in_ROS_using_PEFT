The log messages indicate that the robot only received one waypoint:

- "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.0, y=-10.0."
- "Navigating to waypoint 1..."

The subsequent messages also repeatedly reference the first goal, confirming that no additional waypoints were received:

- "Transitioning to ACTIVE (from WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-25.113)"
- "Failed to get a plan."
- "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

Therefore, the robot received a total of **one waypoint**.
