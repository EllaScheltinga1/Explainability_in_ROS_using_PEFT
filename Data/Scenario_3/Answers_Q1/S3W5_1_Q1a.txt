The robot received a total of 5 waypoints. This can be determined from the series of "Sending goal" log entries for goals 1 through 5:

1. Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=1.0, y=0.0
2. Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-4.5, y=1.5
3. Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=2.0, y=1.0
4. Sending goal 4 to move_base: x=0.0, y=-5.0
5. Sending goal 5 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-9.0
