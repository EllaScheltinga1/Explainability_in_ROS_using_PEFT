The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to multiple waypoints. The robot's sequence of actions and log messages indicate it was assigned goals to navigate to specific coordinates. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown of its task:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The robot started various controllers (joint_state_controller, torso_controller, head_controller, etc.), indicating it prepared its hardware components.
   - The robot tucked its arm, which is usually done to ensure no obstructions during navigation.

2. **Waypoint Navigation:**
   - The robot connected to the `move_base` action server, a typical component in ROS responsible for enabling autonomous navigation.
   - It then sequentially navigated to four waypoints with coordinates:
     - Waypoint 1: \( (2.0, 0.0) \)
     - Waypoint 2: \( (1.0, -1.0) \)
     - Waypoint 3: \( (-3.0, -6.0) \)
     - Waypoint 4: \( (-4.0, -8.5) \)
   
3. **Obstacle Detection:**
   - During its navigation to waypoints, the robot detected obstacles at position \( (0.0, -4.0) \) multiple times, which triggered replanning to successfully reach its destination.

In summary, the robot's task was to autonomously navigate to a series of predefined coordinates while dynamically handling obstacles in its path.
