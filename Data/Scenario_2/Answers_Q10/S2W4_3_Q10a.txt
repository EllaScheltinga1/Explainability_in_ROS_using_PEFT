The task the robot had to perform was navigating through a series of waypoints. The log details the robot starting various controllers necessary for operation, tucking its arm, waiting for and connecting to the move_base action server, and then sequentially navigating to four specific waypoints with coordinates:
1. Waypoint 1: (x=0.5, y=-10.5)
2. Waypoint 2: (x=1.5, y=-11.0)
3. Waypoint 3: (x=-3.0, y=-12.0)
4. Waypoint 4: (x=-3.0, y=-9.0)

During the navigation, the robot detected obstacles and replanned its path to avoid them, eventually reaching each waypoint successfully.
