The robot's task was to autonomously navigate to multiple waypoints. Specifically, the log indicates that the robot was given a series of goals (waypoints) to reach, and it successfully navigated to them while avoiding obstacles. The process involved:

1. Initializing and starting various controllers, such as the arm, head, and mobile base controllers, as well as sensor controllers.
2. Tucking its arm.
3. Attempting to autonomously navigate to a series of goals (waypoints):
   - Waypoint 1 (x=0.0, y=-4.0)
   - Waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=-6.5)
   - Waypoint 3 (x=3.0, y=-10.5)

During the navigation process, the robot detected obstacles and replanned its path as necessary to reach each goal.
