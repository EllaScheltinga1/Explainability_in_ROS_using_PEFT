The task that the robot had to perform involved autonomous navigation through a series of pre-defined waypoints. Here's a detailed breakdown of the task based on the log messages:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Various controllers were started, such as `hand_controller`, `force_torque_sensor_controller`, `joint_state_controller`, `torso_controller`, `head_controller`, `arm_controller`, `mobile_base_controller`, `arm_velocity_trajectory_controller`, and `imu_sensor_controller`.

2. **Navigation to Waypoints**:
   - The robot was connected to the `move_base` action server to receive navigation goals.
   - **Waypoint 1**: 
     - Goal: x=1.0, y=-2.0
     - The robot transitioned to ACTIVE state, navigated to the waypoint, encountered a new obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5), and successfully reached waypoint 1.
   - **Waypoint 2**:
     - Goal: x=1.5, y=-8.0
     - Again, the robot navigated to the next waypoint, detected the same new obstacle, replanned its path as it neared the obstacle, and reached waypoint 2.
   - **Waypoint 3**:
     - Goal: x=-3.0, y=-8.5
     - The robot then navigated to the final waypoint, encountered the obstacle one more time, and successfully reached waypoint 3.

Throughout the task, the robot demonstrated the ability to navigate autonomously, detect and respond to obstacles while ensuring it reached the specified destinations.
