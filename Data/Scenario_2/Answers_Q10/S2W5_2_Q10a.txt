The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to multiple waypoints. The sequence of operations observed in the logs indicates that the robot:

1. Initialized and started various controllers necessary for movement and sensor input.
2. Tucked its arm as a preparatory action.
3. Connected to the `move_base` action server, which handles path planning and obstacle avoidance.
4. Sequentially sent navigation goals to the `move_base` action server for different waypoints with specified coordinates.
5. Detected and responded to obstacles during its path to ensure safe navigation.
6. Successfully navigated to each waypoint, transitioning through various states such as WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE.

Overall, the robot's task involved autonomously navigating to specified locations while handling dynamic obstacles.
