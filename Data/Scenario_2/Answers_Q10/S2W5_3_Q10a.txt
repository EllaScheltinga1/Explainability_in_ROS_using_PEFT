The robot's task was to autonomously navigate to a series of specified waypoints. The log indicates that the robot navigated to five different waypoints with coordinates:

1. Waypoint 1: x = -2.0, y = -1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x = 0.0, y = -0.5
3. Waypoint 3: x = 1.0, y = -3.5
4. Waypoint 4: x = -2.5, y = -5.5
5. Waypoint 5: x = -4.0, y = -9.5

Throughout the navigation, the robot had to detect and avoid obstacles, replan its path if necessary, and confirm when goals were reached. This process involved transitioning through different states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) for each goal sent to the move_base action server.
