The robot's task appears to be autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. Specifically, the robot was given goals to navigate to two distinct coordinates:

1. **Waypoint 1** with coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-5.5)
2. **Waypoint 2** with coordinates (x=-3.5, y=-12.0)

During the task, the robot had to manage potential obstacles, adjust its path, and successfully reach each waypoint. The autonomous navigation process involved monitoring its surrounding environment for obstacles and dynamically replanning its path as needed.
