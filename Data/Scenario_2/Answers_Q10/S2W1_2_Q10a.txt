Based on the provided ROS log messages, the task the robot had to perform was navigating to a specific waypoint. Here's the breakdown:

1. Various controllers necessary for the robot's operation were started, indicating preparation for movement and sensing.
2. The robot's arm was tucked, suggesting it's preparing for mobility.
3. The system waited for and then connected to the move_base action server, which is responsible for handling navigation tasks.
4. A navigation goal was sent with coordinates (x=2.5, y=-7.0).
5. The robot transitioned to an active state for the navigation task.
6. The presence of obstacles was noted during navigation, resulting in a replanning of the path to avoid the obstacle.
7. The robot successfully reached the navigation goal (waypoint 1) and transitioned to a completion state.

Thus, the robot's task was to navigate from its starting position to the specified waypoint at coordinates (x=2.5, y=-7.0).
