The task the robot had to perform was autonomously navigating to specific waypoints while detecting and avoiding obstacles. The log messages indicate that the robot was given goals to move to two different points with specified coordinates: (2.5, 0.0) for waypoint 1 and (-4.0, 1.0) for waypoint 2. During the navigation, the robot detected obstacles and had to replan its path to safely reach the designated waypoints. The successful transitions between different states like "WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK," "ACTIVE," and "DONE," as well as the messages indicating "GOAL Reached!" for each waypoint, confirm that the robot was executing a navigation mission.
