The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to multiple waypoints. The log messages indicate that the robot was sent goals to move to specific coordinates and successfully navigated to and reached each of those waypoints. Specifically, the robot navigated to three waypoints with coordinates (x=1.0, y=-1.0), (x=2.0, y=-1.0), and (x=-4.0, y=-1.5), handling an obstacle detection and path replanning during its navigation to the third waypoint.
