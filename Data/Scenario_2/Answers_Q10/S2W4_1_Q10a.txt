The robot's task was to navigate to a series of waypoints. This is evident from the log messages that detail the robot sending goals to the `move_base` action server, each goal corresponding to specific coordinates (`x` and `y`). The robot transitioned through different states (such as `ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_RESULT`, and `DONE`) as it acknowledged the goals, navigated to them, encountered obstacles, and adjusted its path accordingly to reach the set waypoints. The successful transition to `DONE` and the message "Reached waypoint X" confirm that the robot successfully navigated to the intended waypoints.
