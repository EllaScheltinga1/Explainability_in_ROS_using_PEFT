The robot received a total of 5 waypoints. The logs indicate that the robot successively navigated to each waypoint as follows:

1. Waypoint 1: x=-2.0, y=-1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x=0.0, y=-0.5
3. Waypoint 3: x=1.0, y=-3.5
4. Waypoint 4: x=-2.5, y=-5.5
5. Waypoint 5: x=-4.0, y=-9.5

Each waypoint was sent as a separate goal to the `move_base` action server.
