The log messages indicate that four waypoints were received. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1**: x=2.0, y=0.0
2. **Waypoint 2**: x=1.0, y=-1.0
3. **Waypoint 3**: x=-3.0, y=-6.0
4. **Waypoint 4**: x=-4.0, y=-8.5

Each waypoint is followed by messages about navigating to that waypoint, transitioning states, obstacle detection (if any), and confirmation of GOAL reached.
