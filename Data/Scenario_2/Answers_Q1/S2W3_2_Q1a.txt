The robot received a total of three waypoints. This can be identified by the following log entries:

1. **Waypoint 1**: "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-1.0"
2. **Waypoint 2**: "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=2.0, y=-1.0"
3. **Waypoint 3**: "Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=-4.0, y=-1.5"

Each goal corresponds to a unique waypoint received and processed by the robot.
