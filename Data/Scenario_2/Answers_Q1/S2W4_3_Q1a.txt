The robot received four waypoints. This can be determined from the log entries indicating the sending and reaching of each goal:

1. **Waypoint 1:** 
   - "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=0.5, y=-10.5"
   - "Reached waypoint 1"

2. **Waypoint 2:** 
   - "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=1.5, y=-11.0"
   - "Reached waypoint 2"

3. **Waypoint 3:**
   - "Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-12.0"
   - "Reached waypoint 3"

4. **Waypoint 4:**
   - "Sending goal 4 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=-9.0"
   - "Reached waypoint 4"

Each of these log entries denotes the reception and completion of a waypoint goal, totaling four waypoints.
