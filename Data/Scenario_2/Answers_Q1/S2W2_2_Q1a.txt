Based on the log messages, the robot received and navigated to two waypoints:

1. The first goal was sent to move_base with coordinates \(x=0.5, y=-10.0\), referred to as waypoint 1.
2. The second goal was sent to move_base with coordinates \(x=-3.0, y=-9.5\), referred to as waypoint 2.

Therefore, the robot received two waypoints.
