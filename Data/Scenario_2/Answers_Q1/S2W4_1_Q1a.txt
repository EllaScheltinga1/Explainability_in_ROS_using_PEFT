1. Waypoint 1: `Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.0, y=0.0`
2. Waypoint 2: `Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-1.5, y=0.0`
3. Waypoint 3: `Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=1.0, y=-2.0`
4. Waypoint 4: `Sending goal 4 to move_base: x=0.5, y=-8.5`

Each waypoint was subsequently reached as indicated by the "GOAL Reached!" messages in the log.
