Based on the ROS log messages, the robot received and navigated to 5 waypoints. This is evident from the log entries that detail the sending, navigating, and reaching of goals for waypoints 1 through 5. Each waypoint is associated with a specific goal message sent to the `move_base` action server.

Here is a summary of the waypoints received:

1. Waypoint 1: `x=-4.0, y=0.0`
2. Waypoint 2: `x=1.5, y=0.0`
3. Waypoint 3: `x=2.0, y=-1.5`
4. Waypoint 4: `x=1.0, y=-11.0`
5. Waypoint 5: `x=3.0, y=-7.0`

So, the total number of waypoints received is 5.
