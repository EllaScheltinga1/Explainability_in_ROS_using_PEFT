Based on the ROS log messages, it appears that only one waypoint was received and processed by the robot. The log entry "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.5, y=-7.0" indicates that a goal corresponding to waypoint 1 was sent to the move_base, and subsequent entries discuss actions related to this waypoint, such as navigating, detecting an obstacle, replanning, and finally reaching the goal, but there is no mention of any other waypoints being received or processed.
