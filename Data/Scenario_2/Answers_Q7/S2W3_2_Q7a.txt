No, not all planned paths were initially feasible during the navigation task. At waypoint 3, while navigating to the goal at coordinates (x=-4.0, y=-1.5), the robot detected a new obstacle at position (x=-2.0, y=-1.0). Upon detecting the obstacle, the robot had to replan the path to continue safely to the goal. Despite this path replanning, the robot successfully reached waypoint 3.

In summary, while the paths to waypoints 1 and 2 were feasible without any issues, the path to waypoint 3 required adjustment due to an unforeseen obstacle.
