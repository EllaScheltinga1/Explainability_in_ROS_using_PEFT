Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task.

The robot successfully reached both waypoints despite detecting an obstacle at position (0.5, -6.5) during its navigation. The logs show that the robot was able to replan its path when nearing the obstacle and transitioned through the necessary states (ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) without encountering any failures. This indicates that the robot managed to find and follow feasible paths for both waypoints.
