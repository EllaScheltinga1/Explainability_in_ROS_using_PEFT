Based on the ROS log messages provided, it appears that all planned paths were ultimately feasible, as the robot successfully reached all the waypoints. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=2.0, y=0.0):**
   - The robot navigated to this waypoint without encountering any issues.
   
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=1.0, y=-1.0):**
   - The robot successfully reached this waypoint despite detecting an obstacle at position (0.0, -4.0). The log indicates that it transitioned to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and then to "DONE," confirming that the obstacle did not impede the robot's path to the waypoint.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-3.0, y=-6.0):**
   - The robot encountered an obstacle again at position (0.0, -4.0) and needed to replan its path. However, it successfully navigated around the obstacle, reached the waypoint, and the logs confirm that it transitioned to "DONE."

4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-4.0, y=-8.5):**
   - A new obstacle was detected at the same position (0.0, -4.0), but the robot still managed to navigate to the waypoint successfully, as indicated by the transition to "DONE."

Hence, while obstacles were detected and path replanning was required, all planned paths were ultimately feasible, and the robot achieved all its navigation goals.
