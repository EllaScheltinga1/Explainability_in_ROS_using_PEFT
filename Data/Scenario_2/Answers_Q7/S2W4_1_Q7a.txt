Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Each goal set for the robot was successfully reached, as indicated by the log messages:

1. **Waypoint 1**:
   - Goal (`x=2.0, y=0.0`) was set and reached without issues.

2. **Waypoint 2**:
   - Goal (`x=-1.5, y=0.0`) was set and reached. Although a new obstacle was detected (position: `1.5, -5.0`), it did not prevent the goal from being achieved.

3. **Waypoint 3**:
   - Goal (`x=1.0, y=-2.0`) was set and reached. An obstacle was detected again at the same position (`1.5, -5.0`), but it didn't hinder the robot from reaching the goal.

4. **Waypoint 4**:
   - Goal (`x=0.5, y=-8.5`) was set and reached. The obstacle was detected once more, and it was noted that the robot was nearing the obstacle, prompting path re-planning. Despite this, the goal was still successfully reached.

The logs indicate successful navigation to all set goals, even though the robot had to detect and avoid the same obstacle multiple times. This shows that the paths were feasible and effectively managed by the autonomous system.
