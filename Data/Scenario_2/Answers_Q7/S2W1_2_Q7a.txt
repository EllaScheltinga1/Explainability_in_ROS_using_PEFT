Based on the ROS log messages provided, it appears that not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. This conclusion stems from the following log entries:

1. "New obstacle detected at position (1.0, -4.0)"
2. "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."

These entries indicate that the robot encountered an unexpected obstacle and had to replan its path to continue navigating safely. If all planned paths were initially feasible, there would have been no need for the robot to detect an obstacle and replan its course.

Eventually, the robot successfully navigated to the goal as indicated by:

- "GOAL Reached!"
- "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.150)"
- "Reached waypoint 1."

Therefore, despite the need for re-planning due to an obstacle, the robot was able to reach its goal.
