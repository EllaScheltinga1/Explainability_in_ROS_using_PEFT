Yes, all planned paths were ultimately feasible during the navigation task. Here is a detailed analysis for each goal:

1. **First Goal (Waypoint 1: x=1.0, y=-2.0)**:
   - The robot sent the goal to `move_base` and started navigating without any issues.
   - An obstacle was detected at position (1.5, -5.5), but this obstacle did not impede the path to the first waypoint.
   - The robot transitioned successfully through the states and reached the first waypoint.

2. **Second Goal (Waypoint 2: x=1.5, y=-8.0)**:
   - The robot sent the goal to `move_base` and began navigating.
   - The same obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5) was detected again.
   - The log indicates that the robot noticed it was nearing the obstacle and that the path was replanned.
   - Despite the need for replanning, the robot successfully reached the second waypoint.

3. **Third Goal (Waypoint 3: x=-3.0, y=-8.5)**:
   - The robot sent the goal to `move_base` and started navigating.
   - The obstacle at (1.5, -5.5) was detected once more.
   - The robot handled it similarly by transitioning through states and successfully reaching the third waypoint.

In summary, the robot encountered an obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5) multiple times but managed to replan paths and reach all waypoints. Thus, the planned paths were feasible, though they required dynamic adjustments for obstacle avoidance.
