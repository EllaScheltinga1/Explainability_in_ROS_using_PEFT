Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The logs indicate that the robot successfully reached each of the five waypoints. Here is the sequence confirming the feasibility of each path:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-4.0, y=0.0)**: The robot reported nearing an obstacle and replanned the path, successfully reaching the goal.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=1.5, y=0.0)**: Similar to the first waypoint, the robot encountered an obstacle, replanned the path, and reached the goal.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=2.0, y=-1.5)**: The robot reached the goal without any mention of obstacles or path replanning.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=1.0, y=-11.0)**: The robot reached the goal without any mention of obstacles or path replanning.
5. **Waypoint 5 (x=3.0, y=-7.0)**: The robot reached the goal without any mention of obstacles or path replanning.

For waypoints 1 and 2, the logs specifically noted the robot nearing an obstacle, but the replanning was successful, indicating that the paths remained feasible. The robot transitioned through the appropriate goal states and reached each waypoint as planned.
