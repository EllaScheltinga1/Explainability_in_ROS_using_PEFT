Yes, based on the ROS log messages, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached all specified waypoints despite encountering obstacles and needing to replan its path. Here are the relevant points:

1. It detected a new obstacle and replanned its path while navigating to waypoint 1, but ultimately reached it.
2. It successfully navigated and reached waypoints 2 and 3 without any noted issues.
3. It detected the same obstacle again while navigating to waypoint 4 but still managed to reach the waypoint.

Each waypoint transition followed a sequence of state changes: from waiting for goal acknowledgment to active, reaching the goal, waiting for the result, and then marking the task as done. This consistent pattern indicates that all planned paths were executed successfully.
