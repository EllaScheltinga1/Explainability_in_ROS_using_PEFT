Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully navigated to each of the five waypoints, as indicated by the repeated "GOAL Reached!" messages for each goal. However, new obstacles were detected at position (0.5, -9.0) during the navigation to waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 5. Despite these detections, the robot was able to replan its path accordingly, especially during the navigation to waypoint 3 where explicit path replanning was mentioned, and still reached each goal. This demonstrates that while the original path might have required adjustments due to obstacles, all goals were effectively reached by the robot.
