Based on the ROS log messages, it appears that not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. A new obstacle was detected at position (-2.5, -1.0), necessitating the robot to replan its path. Specifically, the log message "New obstacle detected at position (-2.5, -1.0)" followed by "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." indicates that the initial planned path was obstructed and had to be recalculated to avoid the obstacle and ensure successful navigation to waypoint 1.
