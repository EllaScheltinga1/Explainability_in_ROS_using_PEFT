Yes, all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached both waypoints 1 and 2 as indicated by the "GOAL Reached!" messages. However, it's important to note that while navigating to waypoint 2, a new obstacle was detected, which required the robot to replan its path. Despite this new obstacle, the robot managed to replan the path and eventually reach the goal, indicating the feasibility and effectiveness of the path planning and replanning mechanisms.
