Yes, all planned paths during the navigation task were feasible. The robot successfully navigated to each goal and reached all waypoints despite encountering new obstacles along the path. The following details support this conclusion:

1. **Goal 1 (x=0.0, y=-4.0)**
   - The robot started navigating to the first waypoint.
   - A new obstacle was detected at position (4.0, -8.0), but this did not prevent the robot from reaching the goal.
   - The robot successfully transitioned to the "DONE" state and reached the first waypoint.

2. **Goal 2 (x=2.0, y=-6.5)**
   - The robot started navigating to the second waypoint.
   - Again, a new obstacle was detected at position (4.0, -8.0).
   - Despite the obstacle, the robot successfully transitioned to the "DONE" state and reached the second waypoint.

3. **Goal 3 (x=3.0, y=-10.5)**
   - The robot started navigating to the third waypoint.
   - As it was nearing an obstacle, the path was replanned.
   - After replanning, the robot successfully reached the goal, transitioning to the "DONE" state.

The robot handled the detections of obstacles efficiently through replanning when necessary. Therefore, despite the presence of obstacles, all planned paths were feasible and successfully executed.
