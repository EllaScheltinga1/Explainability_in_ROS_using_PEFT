When the robot detected an obstacle during its navigation to waypoints, it initiated a path replanning process. Specifically, this occurred at two instances:

1. **Waypoint 1:**
   - Log entry: "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
   
2. **Waypoint 2:**
   - Log entry: "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."

In response to the detected obstacles, the robot replanned its path to navigate around the obstacles and successfully reached both waypoints after replanning. This indicates that the robot has a dynamic navigation system capable of altering its path when encountering unexpected obstacles.
