The robot encountered an obstacle at the position (1.5, -5.0) on multiple occasions during its navigation. Here are the robot's responses to these detections:

1. **Waypoint 2**: The obstacle at (1.5, -5.0) was detected, but the log indicates that the robot continued and successfully reached the goal without any additional remarks about path replanning.

2. **Waypoint 3**: The obstacle at (1.5, -5.0) was detected again. Similar to the previous waypoint, the log shows that the robot reached the goal successfully without mentioning any special maneuvers or replanning.

3. **Waypoint 4**: Upon detecting the obstacle at (1.5, -5.0), the robot recognized it was nearing the obstacle and initiated path replanning. The robot successfully reached the goal after adjusting its path.

In summary, the robot consistently detected the obstacle at (1.5, -5.0) and was able to navigate to its goals. Only at waypoint 4 did it explicitly mention replanning the path to avoid the obstacle, indicating an adaptive response to ensure safe navigation.
