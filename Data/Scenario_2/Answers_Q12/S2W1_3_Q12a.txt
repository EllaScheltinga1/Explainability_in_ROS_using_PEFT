When the robot detected a new obstacle at position (0.5, -4.0), it responded by immediately replanning its path. This is indicated by the log message "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." The robot successfully adjusted its navigation strategy to avoid the obstacle, continuing to navigate towards its goal without interruption. Ultimately, the robot reached its destination, as indicated by the "GOAL Reached!" message.
