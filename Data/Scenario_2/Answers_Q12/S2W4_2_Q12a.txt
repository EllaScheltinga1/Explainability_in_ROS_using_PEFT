The robot encountered a detected obstacle several times at the position (0.0, -4.0) during its navigation to waypoints. The log messages indicate the following responses to the obstacle detection:

1. **First Obstacle Detection:**
   - **Waypoint 2:** Upon detecting the obstacle after transitioning to the ACTIVE state (goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-2-19.398), it transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and subsequently to DONE, indicating that the robot reached the goal successfully despite the obstacle.

2. **Second Obstacle Detection:**
   - **Waypoint 3:** The robot detected the obstacle again and provided an additional response: 
     - "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." This demonstrates that the robot actively engaged a path re-planning mechanism to navigate around the obstacle effectively. Despite the obstacle, the robot transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and then to DONE, successfully reaching the goal.

3. **Third Obstacle Detection:**
   - **Waypoint 4:** The obstacle was detected once more. Similar to the earlier responses, the robot transitioned to WAITING_FOR_RESULT from ACTIVE, and then to DONE, indicating successful goal achievement notwithstanding the obstacle.

In summary, the robot responded to the detected obstacle by transitioning to the relevant states and successfully reaching its goals. Specifically, during the navigation to waypoint 3, the robot triggered a path re-planning process to avoid the obstacle. In other cases, it handled the obstacle without explicitly noting any re-planning.
