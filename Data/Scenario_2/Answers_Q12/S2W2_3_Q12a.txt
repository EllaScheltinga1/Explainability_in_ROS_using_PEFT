When the robot detected the new obstacle at position (-3.5, -9.5) during its navigation to waypoint 2, it responded by initiating a replanning process. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the response based on the ROS log messages:

1. **Obstacle Detection:**
   - A new obstacle was detected at position (-3.5, -9.5).

2. **Proximity Notification:**
   - The logs indicated that the robot was nearing the obstacle.

3. **Path Replanning:**
   - The log explicitly stated, "Path is being replanned," which means the robot reassessed its current path and computed a new one to avoid the detected obstacle.

4. **Continued Navigation and Goal Achievement:**
   - Despite the obstacle, the robot successfully navigated to the designated waypoint (Reached waypoint 2).
   
So, in summary, upon detecting the new obstacle, the robot responded by replanning its path to avoid the obstacle and successfully continued its navigation to reach the goal.
