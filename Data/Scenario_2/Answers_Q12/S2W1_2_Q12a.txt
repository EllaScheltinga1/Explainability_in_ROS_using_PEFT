Upon detecting a new obstacle at position (1.0, -4.0), the robot responded by identifying that it was nearing the obstacle. Consequently, the robot began replanning its path to navigate around the detected obstruction. This indicates the robot's autonomy and adaptability in dynamically adjusting its path to ensure safe and efficient navigation. Ultimately, the robot successfully reached its goal despite the obstacle.
