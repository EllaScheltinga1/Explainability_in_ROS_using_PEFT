Based on the ROS log messages, when the robot detected a new obstacle at position (-1.5, 0.5) during its attempt to reach waypoint 2, it responded by replanning its path. The specific log messages "New obstacle detected at position (-1.5, 0.5)" and "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned." indicate that the robot took appropriate action to avoid the obstacle by recalculating its trajectory to ensure safe navigation toward its goal. This replanning allowed the robot to successfully reach its waypoint without collision, as further indicated by the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 2."
