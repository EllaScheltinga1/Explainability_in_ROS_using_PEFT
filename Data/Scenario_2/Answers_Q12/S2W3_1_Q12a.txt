The robot responded to the detected obstacle by replanning its path. Here is a detailed breakdown of its actions based on the logs:

1. **Waypoint 1**:
   - Initial navigation to waypoint 1 does not mention any obstacle.
   - Successfully transitioned through various states and reached the first waypoint.

2. **Waypoint 2**:
   - While navigating to waypoint 2, the log states "New obstacle detected at position (1.5, -5.5)".
   - The robot recognizes that it is nearing the obstacle and begins to replan the path (indicated by the message "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.").
   - Despite the presence of the obstacle, the robot successfully reaches waypoint 2, transitioning through the necessary states.

3. **Waypoint 3**:
   - Again, while navigating to waypoint 3, the obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5) is detected.
   - The robot transitions to WAITING_FOR_RESULT state from ACTIVE.
   - It successfully reaches waypoint 3 despite the detected obstacle.

In summary, upon detecting the obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5), the robot automatically initiates path replanning to avoid the obstacle and continues to successfully reach its designated waypoints. This illustrates the robot's ability to dynamically adapt its navigation path in response to environmental changes.
