The ROS log messages indicate that the robot detected a new obstacle at position (0.5, -9.0) multiple times as it navigated between different waypoints. Here's how the robot responded each time an obstacle was detected:

1. **During Navigation to Waypoint 1:**
   - The log indicates: "New obstacle detected at position (0.5, -9.0)".
   - Despite detecting the obstacle, the robot completed the goal transition process to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" from "ACTIVE" and reached waypoint 1 successfully ("GOAL Reached!").

2. **During Navigation to Waypoint 2:**
   - Again, the log notes: "New obstacle detected at position (0.5, -9.0)".
   - The robot continued its operation, transitioning to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and reaching waypoint 2 successfully ("GOAL Reached!").

3. **During Navigation to Waypoint 3:**
   - The log repeats: "New obstacle detected at position (0.5, -9.0)".
   - This time, an additional message appears: "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
   - Despite needing to replan the path, the robot eventually transitioned to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and successfully reached waypoint 3 ("GOAL Reached!").

4. **During Navigation to Waypoint 5:**
   - The log once again mentions: "New obstacle detected at position (0.5, -9.0)".
   - The robot continued the goal transition process, reaching waypoint 5 successfully ("GOAL Reached!") despite the obstacle.

In summary, upon detecting an obstacle at (0.5, -9.0), the robot primarily proceeded with its navigation tasks, adjusting its path as necessary (notably during navigation to waypoint 3). It successfully reached all specified waypoints while managing the obstacle.
