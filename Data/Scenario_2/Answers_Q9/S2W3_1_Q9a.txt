Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during its navigation tasks. Specifically:

1. An obstacle was detected at position (1.5, -5.5) during the navigation to waypoint 1.
2. The same obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5) was detected again during the navigation to waypoint 2, and the robot had to replan its path while nearing this obstacle.
3. The obstacle at position (1.5, -5.5) was also detected during the navigation to waypoint 3.

These detections indicate that the obstacle was consistently present at the same position during multiple navigation goals.
