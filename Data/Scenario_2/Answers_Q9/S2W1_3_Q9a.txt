Yes, the robot encountered an obstacle during its navigation task. Specifically, the log states, "New obstacle detected at position (0.5, -4.0)". It also mentions that the robot was "nearing the obstacle" and as a result, the "Path is being replanned." Despite this, the robot successfully reached its goal, as noted by the logs that indicate it transitioned to different states and eventually reached the waypoint: "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 1."
