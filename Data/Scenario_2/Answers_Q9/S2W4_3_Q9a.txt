Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task. Specifically, the logs indicate:

1. A new obstacle was detected at position (0.5, -6.5) during the navigation to waypoint 1.
2. The same new obstacle at position (0.5, -6.5) was detected again during the navigation to waypoint 4.

The robot managed these obstacles by replanning its path and continued to reach its goals successfully.
