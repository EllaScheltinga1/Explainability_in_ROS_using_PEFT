Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during its navigation task. Specifically, a new obstacle was detected at position (0.5, -9.0) multiple times during the navigation to different waypoints:

1. Upon reaching waypoint 1, an obstacle was detected at position (0.5, -9.0).
2. While navigating to waypoint 2, the same obstacle position was detected again.
3. During the navigation to waypoint 3, the obstacle at position (0.5, -9.0) was detected once more, and additional log mentions that the robot was nearing the obstacle and the path was being replanned.

No obstacle detections were mentioned for waypoints 4 and 5 apart from the same obstacle at (0.5, -9.0).
