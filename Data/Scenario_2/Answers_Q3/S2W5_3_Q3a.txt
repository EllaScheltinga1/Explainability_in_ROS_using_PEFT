The robot received goal coordinates for five different waypoints during its operation. Here are the coordinates of all the waypoints:

1. Waypoint 1: x = -2.0, y = -1.0
2. Waypoint 2: x = 0.0, y = -0.5
3. Waypoint 3: x = 1.0, y = -3.5
4. Waypoint 4: x = -2.5, y = -5.5
5. Waypoint 5: x = -4.0, y = -9.5
