No, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints mentioned in the log messages. For both waypoints 1 and 2, the log shows the robot transitioning to the final state "DONE" and indicates "GOAL Reached!" for each goal. 

Here are the relevant log entries:
1. For waypoint 1:
   ```
   GOAL Reached!
   Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.127)
   Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.127)
   Reached waypoint 1
   ```

2. For waypoint 2:
   ```
   GOAL Reached!
   Transitioning to WAITING_FOR_RESULT (from ACTIVE, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-2-20.342)
   Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-2-20.342)
   Reached waypoint 2
   ```

Thus, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach.
