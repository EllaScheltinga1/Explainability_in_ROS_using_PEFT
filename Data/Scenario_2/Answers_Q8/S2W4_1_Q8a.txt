No, according to the provided log messages, the robot successfully reached all the designated waypoints. For each waypoint goal sent to `move_base`, the log messages indicate the transition to the `DONE` state, signaling successful completion:

1. **Waypoint 1**: Reached successfully (`Transitioning to DONE... Reached waypoint 1`).
2. **Waypoint 2**: Reached successfully, despite detecting a new obstacle (`Transitioning to DONE... Reached waypoint 2`).
3. **Waypoint 3**: Reached successfully, despite detecting a new obstacle (`Transitioning to DONE... Reached waypoint 3`).
4. **Waypoint 4**: Reached successfully, despite detecting a new obstacle and needing to replan the path (`Transitioning to DONE... Reached waypoint 4`).

Thus, the robot did not fail to reach any of the waypoints.
