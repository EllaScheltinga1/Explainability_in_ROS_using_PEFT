Based on the ROS log messages, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints mentioned. Here is the summary of the waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=-2.0, y=-1.0)**: The robot successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint.
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=0.0, y=-0.5)**: The robot successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint.
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=1.0, y=-3.5)**: The robot successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint, even though a new obstacle was detected.
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-2.5, y=-5.5)**: The robot successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint, despite detecting an obstacle and needing to replan the path.
5. **Waypoint 5 (x=-4.0, y=-9.5)**: The robot successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint after replanning the path due to an obstacle.

All goals transitioned to the "DONE" state after being "ACTIVE," which confirms that the robot reached all waypoints without failure.
