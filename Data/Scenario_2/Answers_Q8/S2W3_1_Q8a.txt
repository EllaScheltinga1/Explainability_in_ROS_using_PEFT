Based on the log messages provided, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints. Here is the sequence of events for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=1.0, y=-2.0)**:
   - Sent goal to `move_base`.
   - Started navigating.
   - Successfully reached the waypoint. 

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=1.5, y=-8.0)**:
   - Sent goal to `move_base`.
   - Started navigating.
   - Successfully reached the waypoint.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-3.0, y=-8.5)**:
   - Sent goal to `move_base`.
   - Started navigating.
   - Successfully reached the waypoint.

Although new obstacles were detected during the navigation to each waypoint, the logs indicate that the robot managed to replan its path when necessary and reached each goal. Thus, no waypoints were missed or failed to be reached.
