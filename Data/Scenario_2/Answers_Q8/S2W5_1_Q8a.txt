According to the ROS log messages, the robot successfully reached all the waypoints provided in the sequence. Here is the breakdown of the waypoints and their corresponding statuses:

1. **Waypoint 1:** x=-4.0, y=0.0
   - Status: GOAL Reached!
   - Confirmation: "Reached waypoint 1"

2. **Waypoint 2:** x=1.5, y=0.0
   - Status: GOAL Reached!
   - Confirmation: "Reached waypoint 2"

3. **Waypoint 3:** x=2.0, y=-1.5
   - Status: GOAL Reached!
   - Confirmation: "Reached waypoint 3"

4. **Waypoint 4:** x=1.0, y=-11.0
   - Status: GOAL Reached!
   - Confirmation: "Reached waypoint 4"

5. **Waypoint 5:** x=3.0, y=-7.0
   - Status: GOAL Reached!
   - Confirmation: "Reached waypoint 5"

Since all waypoints have corresponding "GOAL Reached!" messages and confirmation of reaching each waypoint, there were no waypoints that the robot failed to reach.
