Based on the provided ROS log messages, there are no indications that the robot failed to reach any waypoints. The logs show the sequence of events for navigating to waypoint 1, including sending the goal, detecting an obstacle and replanning the path, and eventually reaching the goal successfully. Specifically, the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Transitioning to DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-1-15.248)" confirm that the robot successfully reached waypoint 1. No log messages suggest any failure in reaching a waypoint.
