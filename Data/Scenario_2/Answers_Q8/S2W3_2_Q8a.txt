Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot reached all the waypoints it attempted. Here are the specific details for each waypoint:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=1.0, y=-1.0)**: 
   - Goal sent and navigation started.
   - Transitioned to active state.
   - Successfully reached the goal.
   - Transitioned to DONE state confirming the waypoint was reached.
   
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=2.0, y=-1.0)**:
   - Goal sent and navigation started.
   - Transitioned to active state.
   - Successfully reached the goal.
   - Transitioned to DONE state confirming the waypoint was reached.
   
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-4.0, y=-1.5)**:
   - Goal sent and navigation started.
   - Transitioned to active state.
   - Detected a new obstacle and replanned the path.
   - Successfully reached the goal despite the obstacle.
   - Transitioned to DONE state confirming the waypoint was reached.

Therefore, the robot successfully reached all waypoints (waypoint 1, waypoint 2, and waypoint 3). None of the waypoints were missed or failed.
