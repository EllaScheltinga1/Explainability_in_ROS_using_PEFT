Yes, all the received waypoints were successfully reached. The log messages indicate that the robot transitioned through the various states such as ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE without any errors, and each time it reached a waypoint, the log states "GOAL Reached!" followed by "Reached waypoint X" where X is the waypoint number (1 through 5). Even when obstacles were detected, the robot successfully replanned its path and reached the targets.
