Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log messages indicate that the robot reached each waypoint as planned. Specifically:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=2.0, y=0.0)**: "GOAL Reached!"
2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-1.5, y=0.0)**: "GOAL Reached!"
3. **Waypoint 3 (x=1.0, y=-2.0)**: "GOAL Reached!"
4. **Waypoint 4 (x=0.5, y=-8.5)**: "GOAL Reached!"

Despite detecting a new obstacle at position (1.5, -5.0) multiple times, the robot was able to navigate successfully and complete each waypoint goal.
