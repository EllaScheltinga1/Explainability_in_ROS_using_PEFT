Based on the provided ROS log messages, the only waypoint mentioned ("waypoint 1") was successfully reached. The log indicates:

1. Goal 1 was sent to the move_base with coordinates x=2.5, y=-7.0.
2. The robot transitioned to an ACTIVE state and started navigating towards waypoint 1.
3. An obstacle was detected, and the path was replanned.
4. The log then states "GOAL Reached!" indicating that waypoint 1 was successfully reached.
5. The robot transitions to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and then to "DONE."

Since the logs only mention waypoint 1 and confirm it was reached, there is no information about any other waypoints. Therefore, based on the given logs, all mentioned waypoints (i.e., waypoint 1) were successfully reached.
