Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached. The ROS log indicates the robot received two waypoints:

1. Waypoint 1 at coordinates (x=2.5, y=0.0)
2. Waypoint 2 at coordinates (x=-4.0, y=1.0)

The log entries show successful transitions and completion for both waypoints:
- For Waypoint 1:
  - "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=2.5, y=0.0"
  - "Transitioning to ACTIVE"
  - "GOAL Reached!"
  - "Transitioning to DONE"
  - "Reached waypoint 1"
  
- For Waypoint 2:
  - "Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-4.0, y=1.0"
  - "Transitioning to ACTIVE"
  - "Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned."
  - "GOAL Reached!"
  - "Transitioning to DONE"
  - "Reached waypoint 2"

These logs confirm that the robot successfully navigated to and reached both waypoints given.
