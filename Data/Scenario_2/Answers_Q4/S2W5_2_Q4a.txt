Yes, all received waypoints were successfully reached by the robot. The log messages indicate that the robot sequentially transitioned through various states (WAITING_FOR_GOAL_ACK, ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, and DONE) for each waypoint goal, and each transition to the DONE state was accompanied by a log entry stating "GOAL Reached!" followed by "Reached waypoint \<number\>". The sequence was as follows:

1. **Waypoint 1** (`x=2.0, y=-4.0`)
   - Goal sent and acknowledged.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Logged: "GOAL Reached! Reached waypoint 1".

2. **Waypoint 2** (`x=1.0, y=-6.0`)
   - Goal sent and acknowledged.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Logged: "GOAL Reached! Reached waypoint 2".

3. **Waypoint 3** (`x=2.0, y=-11.0`)
   - Goal sent and acknowledged.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Path replanned due to obstacle.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Logged: "GOAL Reached! Reached waypoint 3".

4. **Waypoint 4** (`x=-2.5, y=-12.0`)
   - Goal sent and acknowledged.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Logged: "GOAL Reached! Reached waypoint 4".

5. **Waypoint 5** (`x=-3.0, y=-9.0`)
   - Goal sent and acknowledged.
   - Transitioned to ACTIVE.
   - Transitioned to DONE.
   - Logged: "GOAL Reached! Reached waypoint 5".

Despite the detection of a recurring obstacle at position `(0.5, -9.0)`, the robot managed to successfully navigate to and reach all five waypoints.
