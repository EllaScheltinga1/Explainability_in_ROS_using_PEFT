Based on the provided log messages, the robot did not explicitly encounter physical obstacles during the navigation task. However, there were issues related to the global costmap while attempting to reach waypoint 4. Specifically:

1. **For Waypoint 4:**
   - **Log Entry:** "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
   - **Action:** Clearing both costmaps outside specified areas centered on the robot.
   - **Recovery Attempts:** Rotate recovery behavior started.
   - **Result:** "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

The mentioned logs suggest that the goal could not be planned within the provided global costmap boundaries, and the robot's planning and recovery attempts were unsuccessful. This could be interpreted as a navigation obstacle, but it was not a physical obstruction in the robot's direct pathâ€”it was a limitation in the planning area of the costmap.

So, while there is no evidence of physical obstacles like objects or walls, there was a planning issue related to the costmap boundaries that prevented the robot from successfully navigating to waypoint 4.
