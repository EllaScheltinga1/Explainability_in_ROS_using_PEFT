Yes, the robot encountered obstacles during the navigation task, particularly when trying to reach waypoint 2. The log indicates the following issues:

1. **Waypoint 2**:
   - The robot received information stating, "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
   - Despite clearing both costmaps and initiating recovery behaviors like the rotate recovery behavior, the goal remained off the global costmap, causing the planning to fail.
   - Ultimately, the log states, "Failed to reach waypoint 2," indicating the robot could not navigate around or to this location due to obstacles or the goal being unreachable within the known map.

2. **Waypoint 3**:
   - Initially, the robot encountered planning difficulties, as noted by "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
   - Despite these initial issues, the robot did eventually reach waypoint 3 after further attempts, suggesting that any obstacles were eventually managed or a valid path was found.

It's important to note that the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 3, and 4 without notable issues after the initial recovery attempts for waypoint 3.
