No direct obstacles were mentioned in the log messages during the navigation task. However, the robot encountered an issue with the second goal sent to the move_base action server. The log indicated that "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal," suggesting a configuration issue with the goal rather than physical obstacles. The system attempted recovery behaviors (clearing costmaps, rotate recovery) but ultimately aborted because a valid plan could not be found, which points to a problem with the specified goal location rather than immediate physical obstacles.
