Based on the provided ROS log messages, there is no direct indication of obstacles encountered during the navigation task. The primary issue noted in the logs is that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, which means the navigation goal was outside the area the planner can consider for planning a route. This error directly caused the planning to fail.

Here are the relevant log entries:
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

These entries explain that the robot could not find a valid path to the goal due to its position relative to the costmap, resulting in failed navigation efforts. It does not mention any obstacles directly affecting the navigation.
