Yes, during the navigation task, the robot encountered an issue that can be interpreted as an obstacle when attempting to reach waypoint 3. Specifically, the logs indicate that:

1. **The goal was off the global costmap**: "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal." This suggests that the waypoint was beyond the known or accessible area, which is akin to an obstacle from the robot's perspective.

2. **Recovery behaviors were executed**: "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot." and "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot." This indicates attempts were made to clear any temporary obstacles.

3. **Recovery behaviors failed**: "Rotate recovery behavior started." and "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors." These attempts imply the robot explored recovery strategies but was unsuccessful.

The combination of these log entries points to the navigation system encountering an obstacle that it could not overcome, leading to the failure in reaching waypoint 3.
