Based on the ROS log messages, there is no explicit mention of obstacles during the navigation tasks for waypoints 1 to 4. The transitions from "ACTIVE" to "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" and then to "DONE" suggest that the robot successfully navigated to these waypoints without encountering any major issues.

However, for waypoint 5, the log indicates a problem with planning due to the goal being off the global costmap:
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
- "Rotate recovery behavior started."
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

These messages, particularly the mention of clearing the costmaps and the recovery behavior attempts, suggest the robot encountered difficulties due to the goal being unreachable within the planned global costmap area, ultimately leading to the failure to reach waypoint 5. This isn't an obstacle in the traditional sense (like a physical object in the path), but rather a limitation in the planned route and the robot's ability to navigate to the specified coordinates.
