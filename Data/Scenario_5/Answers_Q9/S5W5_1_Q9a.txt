Based on the ROS log messages, the robot encountered an obstacle while attempting to navigate to waypoint 4.

Here's a detailed explanation:
1. For waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 5, the robot successfully navigated without any noted obstacles. The log indicates:
   - Goals were sent to the `move_base` action server.
   - The goals transitioned to "ACTIVE" status.
   - The robot reached the goals.
   - The log indicated successful status transitions to "DONE" after reaching each waypoint.

2. However, for waypoint 4 (coordinates: x=6.0, y=-7.0):
   - The log states, "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal." This indicates that the targeted waypoint was outside the accessible map the robot was using to navigate.
   - Recovery behaviors were executed (e.g., costmap clearing and rotate recovery), but still, the plan failed.
   - The message "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors" confirms an obstruction or unreachable area was encountered.
   - As a result, the robot failed to reach waypoint 4.

In summary, the robot faced a significant obstacle during the attempt to navigate to waypoint 4, which it could not overcome despite recovery behaviors. For all other waypoints, no obstacles were reported.
