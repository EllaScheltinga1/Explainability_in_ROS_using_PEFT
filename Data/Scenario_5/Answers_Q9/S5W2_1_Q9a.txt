Based on the ROS log messages provided, it appears that the robot encountered some navigation issues, but there are no explicit mentions of physical obstacles. The main concerns highlighted in the log messages include:

1. **Off-Costmap Goal (Waypoint 1)**:
   - The log states, "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
   - This suggests that the goal for waypoint 1 was outside of the area the robot can plan a path for, leading to immediate planning failure.

2. **Recovery Behaviors**:
   - The logs show the robot attempting recovery behaviors such as "Clearing both costmaps outside a square" and "Rotate recovery behavior started."
   - These actions are typically indicative of the robot trying to recover from a navigation failure, which could be due to encountering difficult terrain or being unable to find a valid path.

3. **Failed Waypoint (Waypoint 1)**:
   - The final status for waypoint 1 is "Failed to reach waypoint 1," which is likely due to the off-costmap goal rather than specific obstacles.

4. **Aborted Goal (Waypoint 2)**:
   - The robot initially failed to navigate to waypoint 2 with the message, "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
   - This indicates that despite attempts to find a path, planning failed, possibly suggesting issues with navigation but not explicitly mentioning obstacles.

5. **Successful Navigation (Waypoint 2)**:
   - Eventually, the log indicates success with "GOAL Reached!" for waypoint 2, suggesting a successful navigation after initial failure.

In summary, the logs do not explicitly mention obstacles but do indicate issues with navigation planning and recovery attempts.
