Yes, an obstacle was encountered during the navigation task to waypoint 3. The log indicates that the robot sent a goal to the global planner, but the goal was off the global costmap, causing planning to always fail. Efforts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors such as the "rotate recovery behavior" did not succeed, resulting in the failure to find a valid path to the goal and subsequently aborting the navigation to that waypoint.
