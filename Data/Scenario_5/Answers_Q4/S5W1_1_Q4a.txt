No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The log messages indicate that there was an attempt to navigate to waypoint 1 with coordinates x=-6.0 and y=-10.0. However, the goal was determined to be off the global costmap, leading to a failure in planning. Despite executing recovery behaviors, a valid plan could not be found, and the navigation to waypoint 1 was subsequently aborted. The final log entry explicitly states, "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
