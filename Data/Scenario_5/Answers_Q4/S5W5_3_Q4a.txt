No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, 4, and 5 but failed to reach waypoint 3. The log indicates an issue with the goal for waypoint 3 being off the global costmap, resulting in the failure to find a valid plan even after executing recovery behaviors.
