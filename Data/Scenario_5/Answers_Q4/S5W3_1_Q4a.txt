No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The robot attempted to navigate to three waypoints:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=5.5, y=0.0)**: The navigation failed for this waypoint. The goal was off the global costmap, making planning impossible. Despite executing all recovery behaviors, no valid plan could be found, resulting in the abortion of the attempt and the robot failing to reach waypoint 1.

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=3.0, y=-7.0)**: The robot successfully navigated to this waypoint and reached it.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-2.5, y=0.0)**: The robot also successfully navigated to and reached this waypoint.

Thus, out of the three received waypoints, only the second and third waypoints were successfully reached.
