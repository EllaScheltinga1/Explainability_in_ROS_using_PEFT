No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. The logs indicate that the robot attempted to reach "waypoint 1" at coordinates x=9.0, y=-6.0, but it failed to do so. The specific messages highlight that the goal was off the global costmap, leading to failed planning attempts. Despite executing recovery behaviors, the robot could not find a valid plan to reach the waypoint and ultimately aborted the mission.
