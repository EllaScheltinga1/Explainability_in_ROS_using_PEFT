No, not all received waypoints were successfully reached. According to the log messages, the robot attempted to navigate to "waypoint 1" but encountered issues. Specifically, the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, which means it was outside the area the planner could work within. This led to planning failures and eventually caused the robot to abort the navigation attempt after executing all available recovery behaviors. The transition to the DONE state indicates the process ended without the robot reaching the intended waypoint. Therefore, the attempt to reach waypoint 1 was unsuccessful.
