No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot encountered an issue where the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap. This caused planning to always fail for this goal, as indicated by the repeated log message "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal." Despite the robot attempting recovery behaviors, including clearing costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior, it ultimately aborted the mission because a valid plan could not be found. This indicates that the planned paths were not feasible, and the robot failed to reach waypoint 1.
