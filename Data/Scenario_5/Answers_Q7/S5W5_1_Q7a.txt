No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. While the robot successfully reached waypoints 1, 2, 3, and 5, it failed to reach waypoint 4. The log messages indicate that the goal for waypoint 4 was outside the global costmap, meaning that the global planner could not create a valid path to this location. Despite attempts to clear the costmaps and executing recovery behaviors, the robot aborted the attempt to reach waypoint 4 because a valid plan could not be found.
