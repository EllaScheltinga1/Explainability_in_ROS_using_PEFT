No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The first two goals (waypoints 1 and 2) were successfully reached. However, the third goal (waypoint 3) was not feasible. The log indicates that the goal for waypoint 3 was off the global costmap, resulting in a failed plan despite attempts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors. As a result, the robot aborted the attempt and failed to reach waypoint 3.
