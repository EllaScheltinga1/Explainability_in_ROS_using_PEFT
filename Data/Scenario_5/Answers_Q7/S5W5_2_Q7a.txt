No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that the robot successfully navigated to waypoints 1 through 4. However, the path to waypoint 5 was not feasible because the goal was off the global costmap, leading to planning failures even after executing recovery behaviors. The logs specifically mention:

- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Failed to reach waypoint 5"
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

These entries confirm that the path to waypoint 5 was not feasible.
