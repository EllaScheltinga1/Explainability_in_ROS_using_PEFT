No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The robot successfully reached the first two waypoints (waypoint 1: x=-3.0, y=-6.0 and waypoint 2: x=-3.0, y=-12.0), but it encountered an issue with the third waypoint (waypoint 3: x=-2.0, y=-14.0). The log indicates that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, meaning the planner could not generate a valid path to this waypoint. Despite executing recovery behaviors, the system had to abort the mission for waypoint 3 due to the inability to find a valid plan.
