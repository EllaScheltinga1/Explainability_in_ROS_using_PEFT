No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log indicates that the robot successfully reached waypoint 1, but encountered issues while navigating to waypoint 2. Specifically, the goal for waypoint 2 was determined to be off the global costmap, resulting in planning failures. Despite attempts to clear the costmaps and perform recovery behaviors, the robot was unable to generate a valid plan and ultimately aborted the goal, failing to reach waypoint 2.
