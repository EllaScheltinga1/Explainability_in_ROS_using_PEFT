No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. According to the log messages, waypoints 1, 2, and 3 were successfully navigated and reached by the robot. However, the robot failed to reach waypoint 4. 

The logs indicate that the goal sent to the global planner for waypoint 4 was off the global costmap, making planning to that goal impossible. Despite attempts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors, the robot was unable to find a valid plan to reach waypoint 4, leading to the goal being aborted and marking waypoint 4 as failed to reach.
