No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=1.0, y=-10.0)**:
   - The robot successfully reached this waypoint as indicated by the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 1."

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-6.0, y=0.0)**:
   - The robot failed to reach this waypoint. The logs indicate that the goal was off the global costmap, and planning always failed for this goal. Despite attempts to clear costmaps and execute recovery behaviors, it transitioned to "DONE" with "Failed to reach waypoint 2."

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-3.0, y=-9.5)**:
   - There was an initial failure attempt as well: “Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors”. However, the robot eventually reached this waypoint, as indicated by the message "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 3."

4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-1.5, y=-8.0)**:
   - The robot successfully reached this waypoint as indicated by the messages "GOAL Reached!" and "Reached waypoint 4."

So, the planned path to Waypoint 2 was not feasible, while the other waypoints (1, 3, and 4) were feasible.
