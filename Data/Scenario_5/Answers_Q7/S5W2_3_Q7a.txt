No, none of the planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log messages indicate that both goals sent to the global planner were off the global costmap, resulting in failed planning attempts and aborted missions after executing all recovery behaviors. Specifically:

1. **For Waypoint 1 (x=6.0, y=-2.0)**:
   - The goal was off the global costmap, causing the planning to fail.
   - Recovery behaviors, including clearing costmaps and executing rotate recovery, did not resolve the issue.
   - The navigation transitioned to DONE with the goal unachieved, resulting in the failure to reach waypoint 1.

2. **For Waypoint 2 (x=-8.0, y=5.0)**:
   - Similarly, the goal was off the global costmap, leading to a fail in planning.
   - Recovery actions, such as costmap clearing and rotate recovery, were also ineffective.
   - The navigation process ended with the goal unfulfilled, leading to the failure to reach waypoint 2.

In summary, both planned paths to the waypoints were not feasible according to the logs.
