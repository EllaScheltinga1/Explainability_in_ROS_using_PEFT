No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. Specifically, the goal for waypoint 1 (x=5.5, y=0.0) was deemed unachievable because it was outside the global costmap, causing the global planner to consistently fail in generating a valid plan. Despite multiple attempts and recovery behaviors, the robot was unable to reach waypoint 1 and eventually aborted the attempt. However, the robot successfully reached waypoints 2 (x=3.0, y=-7.0) and 3 (x=-2.5, y=0.0) as planned.
