No, all the planned paths were not feasible during the navigation task. 

The log messages indicate that multiple goals sent to the global planner were off the global costmap, resulting in continuous planning failures. For each waypoint (1 through 4):

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=6.0, y=-14.5)**: 
   - The goal was off the global costmap.
   - Planning always failed, even after executing all recovery behaviors.

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-3.0, y=1.5)**: 
   - The planner failed to get a plan.
   - Recovery behaviors did not resolve the issue.

3. **Waypoint 3 (x=-7.5, y=-6.0)**: 
   - The goal was off the global costmap.
   - Planning always failed, even after attempting recovery behaviors.

4. **Waypoint 4 (x=-8.0, y=3.0)**:
   - The goal was off the global costmap.
   - Multiple recovery attempts failed to make the path feasible.

In summary, none of the paths planned for waypoints 1 through 4 were feasible, leading to the robot failing to reach any of the specified waypoints.
