No, not all planned paths were feasible during the navigation task. The log specifically indicates that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, which caused planning to always fail for that goal. Despite the robot attempting recovery behaviors such as clearing costmaps and initiating a rotate recovery behavior, it ultimately aborted the navigation task because a valid plan could not be found. This sequence of events confirms that the planned paths to waypoint 1 were not feasible.
