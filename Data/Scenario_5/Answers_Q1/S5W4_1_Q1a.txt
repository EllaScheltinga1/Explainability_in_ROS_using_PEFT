The robot received four waypoints. This can be determined from the log entries indicating "Sending goal X to move_base," where X corresponds to a sequence number, from 1 to 4:
1. Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=6.0, y=-14.5
2. Sending goal 2 to move_base: x=-3.0, y=1.5
3. Sending goal 3 to move_base: x=-7.5, y=-6.0
4. Sending goal 4 to move_base: x=-8.0, y=3.0

Each of these log entries signifies the reception of a waypoint.
