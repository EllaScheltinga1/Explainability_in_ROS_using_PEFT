Five waypoints were received. This can be inferred from the log messages indicating goals being sent to the `move_base` action server for each waypoint. Explicitly, goals were sent for:

1. Waypoint 1: `x=-3.0, y=0.0`
2. Waypoint 2: `x=0.0, y=0.0`
3. Waypoint 3: `x=2.5, y=-7.0`
4. Waypoint 4: `x=6.0, y=-7.0`
5. Waypoint 5: `x=1.0, y=-9.0`

Each of these goals is clearly logged as being sent to the `move_base` action server.
