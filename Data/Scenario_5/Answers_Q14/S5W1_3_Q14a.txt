The robot deployed several mechanisms to handle unfeasible paths:

1. **Costmap Clearing**: 
   - The robot attempted to clear its costmaps (a representation of the environment used for navigation) to potentially resolve any inaccuracies or obstacles that might have been causing the goal to be off the global costmap. 
   - Initially, the robot cleared the costmaps outside a 3.00m square centered on itself, and then it tried again with a smaller 1.50m square.

2. **Recovery Behavior**:
   - After the costmap clearing attempts, the robot executed a rotate recovery behavior. This typically involves the robot rotating in place to reassess its surroundings and possibly find a new viable path or reevaluate its position.

Despite these efforts, the log indicates that the robot still could not find a valid plan to reach the goal, and ultimately aborted the mission due to the ongoing infeasibility of the path. This is reflected in the transitions from ACTIVE to WAITING_FOR_RESULT and finally to DONE, culminating in the statement that the robot failed to reach waypoint 1.
