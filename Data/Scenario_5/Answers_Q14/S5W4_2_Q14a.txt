The robot employed several recovery strategies when it encountered unfeasible paths:

1. **Clearing Costmaps:**
    - The system attempted to clear the local and global costmaps around the robot. Initially, it cleared a larger 3.00-meter square area centered on the robot.
    - After that, it attempted to clear a smaller 1.50-meter square area around the robot.

2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior:**
    - When clearing the costmaps did not yield a feasible path, the robot initiated a "rotate recovery behavior." This behavior typically involves the robot spinning on the spot in an attempt to reorient itself and find a new path.

Despite these recovery attempts, the path to waypoint 4 remained unfeasible because the goal was consistently off the global costmapâ€”indicating that the target location was outside the known navigable area or obstructed by permanent obstacles. Consequently, the robot aborted the attempt to reach waypoint 4 after executing all recovery behaviors and transitioned back to the "WAITING_FOR_RESULT" state before eventually marking the goal as "DONE" with a failure status.
