The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to specified waypoints. Based on the ROS log messages, the robot was navigating to a series of waypoints provided as goals to the `move_base` action server. 

1. The robot successfully navigated to the first waypoint at coordinates (x=-3.0, y=0.5).
2. The robot attempted to navigate to the second waypoint at coordinates (x=2.0, y=-13.0) but failed due to the goal being outside the global costmap, resulting in aborted planning attempts and eventual failure to reach the waypoint.

The log messages indicate that the robot was executing a sequence of navigation tasks involving movement to predefined locations while dealing with the challenges encountered during the navigation process.
