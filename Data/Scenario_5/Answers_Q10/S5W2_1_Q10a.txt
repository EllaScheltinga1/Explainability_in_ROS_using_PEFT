The robot's task appears to be waypoint navigationâ€”moving to specified waypoints based on given coordinates. The log messages indicate that the robot received navigation goals (waypoints) with specific x and y coordinates. The robot then attempted to navigate to these waypoints, encountered various obstacles or issues, and reported its progress back.

Specifically:
1. The robot first tried to reach waypoint 1 at coordinates (x=-1.0, y=5.0), but the goal was outside the global costmap, causing the planning to fail.
2. The robot then tried to reach waypoint 2 at coordinates (x=2.0, y=0.0). Despite initial challenges in finding a valid plan, the robot eventually succeeded in reaching this waypoint.

Overall, the robot was executing a sequence of navigation tasks to move from one waypoint to another based on provided coordinates.
