The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to a waypoint with coordinates \(x = 7.0, y = -2.0\). This is evidenced by the log messages indicating that the robot was **"Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=7.0, y=-2.0"** and subsequently attempting to navigate to the specified waypoint. However, it failed to reach the waypoint due to issues with the goal being off the global costmap and unsuccessful recovery attempts.
