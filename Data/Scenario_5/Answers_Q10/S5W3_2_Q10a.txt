The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to a series of waypoints. The log messages indicate that the robot was tasked with navigating to three specific coordinates (referred to as waypoints) in sequence:

1. **Waypoint 1:** Coordinates (x=1.0, y=-11.5)
2. **Waypoint 2:** Coordinates (x=-2.0, y=-12.0)
3. **Waypoint 3:** Coordinates (x=-6.0, y=-9.0)

The robot successfully navigated to the first two waypoints but encountered an issue with the third waypoint, which was off the global costmap, leading to a failure in planning a valid path and ultimately unable to reach waypoint 3.
