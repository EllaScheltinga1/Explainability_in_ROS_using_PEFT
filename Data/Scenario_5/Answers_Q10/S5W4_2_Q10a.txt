The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation to specific waypoints. This is evidenced by the series of logs detailing the robot being sent goals in the form of coordinates (x, y) and the subsequent status transitions as it attempts to reach these waypoints. The robot successfully navigated to waypoints 1, 2, and 3, but failed to reach waypoint 4 due to planning issues related to the global costmap.
