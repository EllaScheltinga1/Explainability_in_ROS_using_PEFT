The robot was tasked with navigating to a series of waypoints. This task is evident from the log messages indicating goals being sent to the `move_base` action server (such as `Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=5.5, y=0.0`) and subsequent navigation attempts to those waypoints (e.g., `Navigating to waypoint 1...`). The robot successfully reached waypoints 2 and 3 while failing to reach waypoint 1 due to the goal being off the global costmap, leading to failed planning attempts and executed recovery behaviors.
