The task the robot had to perform was an autonomous navigation mission involving traveling to multiple waypoints. The log indicates that the robot was given sequential goals to navigate to specific coordinates, performed actions to reach these waypoints, and handled errors or recovery behaviors when a valid path could not be planned. 

Here is a summary of the key actions logged:
- The robot successfully reached waypoint 1.
- The robot failed to reach waypoint 2 because the goal was off the global costmap, making it impossible for the global planner to generate a valid path.
- The robot successfully reached waypoint 3 after initially failing to find a valid plan and executing recovery behaviors.
- The robot successfully reached waypoint 4 without any errors.

In essence, the robot's task was to navigate autonomously to a series of specified waypoints, adjusting its route or executing recovery behaviors when necessary.
