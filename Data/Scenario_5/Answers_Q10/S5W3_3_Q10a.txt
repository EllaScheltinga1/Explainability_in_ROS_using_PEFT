The task the robot had to perform was autonomous navigation through a series of waypoints. The robot was instructed to move to specific coordinates (waypoints) in sequence and used the ROS `move_base` action server to navigate to these destinations. 

- **Waypoint 1**: Coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-6.0)
- **Waypoint 2**: Coordinates (x=-3.0, y=-12.0)
- **Waypoint 3**: Coordinates (x=-2.0, y=-14.0)

The robot successfully reached waypoints 1 and 2, but failed to reach waypoint 3 because the goal was off the global costmap, causing planning and recovery behaviors to fail.
