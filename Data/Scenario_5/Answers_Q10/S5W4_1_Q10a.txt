The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to specified waypoints by sending navigation goals to the `move_base` action server. The waypoints included specific coordinates (x, y) where the robot was expected to move to and likely complete a task or reach a location as part of its autonomous mission. However, the robot encountered issues with all the waypoints, where the goals were off the global costmap, making it impossible for the robot to plan a valid path to reach those destinations. Despite attempts at recovery behaviors, the robot ultimately failed to reach any of the waypoints.
