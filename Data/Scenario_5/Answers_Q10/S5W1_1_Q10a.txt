The task the robot had to perform was to navigate to a specific waypoint. According to the log messages, the goal was set at coordinates x=-6.0, y=-10.0, and the robot was tasked with moving to this location using the **move_base** action server, which is typically used for navigation tasks in ROS. The robot attempted to follow its navigation plan to reach this waypoint, referred to as "waypoint 1".
