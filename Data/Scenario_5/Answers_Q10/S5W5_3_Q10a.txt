The robot was tasked with navigating to a series of waypoints. Based on the log messages, the waypoints provided to the robot included specific coordinates (x, y values). The robot followed these steps:

1. Waited for and connected to the move_base action server.
2. Sent goals to the move_base system with specific coordinates (x, y).
3. Transitioned through various states (e.g., ACTIVE, WAITING_FOR_RESULT, DONE) while moving towards each waypoint.
4. Successfully reached most waypoints, except for waypoint 3, where the goal was off the global costmap, making planning impossible.
5. Performed a recovery behavior after failing to reach waypoint 3 and then proceeded to subsequent waypoints.

The robotâ€™s task was essentially autonomous navigation, moving from one waypoint to another as directed.
