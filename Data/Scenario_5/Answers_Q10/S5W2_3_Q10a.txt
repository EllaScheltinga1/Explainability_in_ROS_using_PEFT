The robot's task was to navigate to predefined waypoints using the `move_base` action server. This is evident from the log entries where the robot sends navigation goals to the `move_base` server with specific coordinates (e.g., `x=6.0, y=-2.0` for waypoint 1 and `x=-8.0, y=5.0` for waypoint 2). The robot then attempts to reach these waypoints but fails due to planning issues.
