The robot did not successfully reach any waypoints based on the provided log messages. Both attempts to reach waypoint 1 (x=6.0, y=-2.0) and waypoint 2 (x=-8.0, y=5.0) failed. In both cases, the log indicates that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, causing the planning to always fail. Despite attempting recovery behaviors and clearing costmaps, a valid plan could not be found for either waypoint, resulting in mission failure for both waypoints.
