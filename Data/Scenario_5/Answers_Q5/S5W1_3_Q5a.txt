The robot did not reach the first waypoint. According to the log messages, the robot attempted to navigate to the first waypoint with coordinates x=9.0, y=-6.0. However, this goal was off the global costmap, leading to repeated failures in planning. Ultimately, all recovery behaviors were executed without success, and the robot aborted the navigation attempt, failing to reach waypoint 1.
