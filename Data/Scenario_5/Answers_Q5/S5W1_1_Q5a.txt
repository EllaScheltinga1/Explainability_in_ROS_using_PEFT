The robot did not successfully reach the first waypoint. According to the log messages, the robot attempted to navigate to waypoint 1 located at coordinates x=-6.0, y=-10.0. However, the goal was off the global costmap, causing the planning to fail repeatedly and triggering recovery behaviors. Ultimately, the robot aborted the attempt and transitioned through the states without reaching the waypoint, as indicated by the final message stating "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
