The robot did not successfully reach the first waypoint. The log shows that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, which means that the planner could not generate a valid path to the waypoint. Despite attempts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors, the robot ultimately failed to find a valid plan and aborted the mission. Therefore, the robot never reached waypoint 1.
