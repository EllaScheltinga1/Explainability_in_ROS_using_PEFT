Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 5. The logs indicate that the goal sent to the global planner for waypoint 5 was off the global costmap, which meant that planning would always fail for this goal. Despite executing recovery behaviors, the robot was unable to find a valid plan to reach waypoint 5, resulting in the following log entry: 

"Failed to reach waypoint 5  
Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."
