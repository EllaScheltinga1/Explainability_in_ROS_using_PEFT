Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 4. 

The log entries indicate that the goal for waypoint 4 was off the global costmap, resulting in planning failures. Despite attempts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors, a valid plan could not be established, leading to the abortion of the goal. The relevant log messages are:

- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
- "Rotate recovery behavior started."
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors."

These messages show the robot's unsuccessful attempts to navigate to waypoint 4 and the ultimate failure to reach it.
