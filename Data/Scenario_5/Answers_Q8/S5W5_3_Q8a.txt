Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 3. The logs indicate:

1. The goal for waypoint 3 was outside the global costmap, causing the planner to fail.
2. Various recovery behaviors (including costmap clearing and rotate recovery behavior) were attempted but did not succeed in finding a valid plan.
3. The robot ultimately aborted the attempt, transitioning the state to DONE without achieving the goal.

The corresponding log messages confirm this sequence of events:
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
- "Rotate recovery behavior started."
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
- "Failed to reach waypoint 3"
