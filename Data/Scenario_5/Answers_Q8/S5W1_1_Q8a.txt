Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 1. The logs indicate that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, leading to an inability to plan to the goal. Despite executing all recovery behaviors, a valid plan could not be found, resulting in the navigation goal being aborted. This is confirmed by the final log entry: "Failed to reach waypoint 1."
