Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2. The logs indicate that after sending goal 2 to move_base with coordinates x=2.0 and y=-13.0, various issues were encountered. The key messages that point to the failure include:

- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"

These messages indicate that despite attempts to clear the costmaps and execute recovery behaviors, the global planner could not generate a valid plan for reaching waypoint 2. As a result, the navigation was aborted, and the robot transitioned to a DONE state without successfully reaching waypoint 2.
