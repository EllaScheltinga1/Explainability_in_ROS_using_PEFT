Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 2. The log entry indicates that the goal for waypoint 2 was off the global costmap, which means that the planning process was unable to find a valid path to that goal. Despite attempts to clear costmaps and perform recovery behaviors, the robot could not reach the target, leading to an unsuccessful waypoint 2 mission. Specifically, the messages reflect the following sequence:

- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (3.00m) large centered on the robot."
- "Clearing both costmaps outside a square (1.50m) large centered on the robot."
- "Rotate recovery behavior started."
- "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
- "Failed to reach waypoint 2"

Ultimately, the robot transitioned to "DONE (from WAITING_FOR_RESULT, goal: /tiago_autonomous_navigation-2-48.879)" without achieving waypoint 2.
