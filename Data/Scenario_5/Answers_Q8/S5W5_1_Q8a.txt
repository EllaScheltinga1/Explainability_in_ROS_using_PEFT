Yes, the robot failed to reach waypoint 4. The log indicates that the goal sent to the global planner was off the global costmap, meaning the planner could not find a valid path to this waypoint. Despite attempts to execute recovery behaviors, the robot still couldn't generate a feasible plan, leading to the waypoint being marked as failed. This is confirmed by the log entry: "Failed to reach waypoint 4."
