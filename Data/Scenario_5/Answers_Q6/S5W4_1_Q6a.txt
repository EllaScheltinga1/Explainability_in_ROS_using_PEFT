Based on the provided ROS log messages, the robot failed to reach any of the specified waypoints. Each attempt to navigate to a waypoint results in a failure message. The logs indicate attempts to navigate to four different waypoints, but all four attempts were unsuccessful due to issues like goals being off the global costmap and failed recovery behaviors.

Thus, the robot did not successfully reach any waypoints according to the log entries.
