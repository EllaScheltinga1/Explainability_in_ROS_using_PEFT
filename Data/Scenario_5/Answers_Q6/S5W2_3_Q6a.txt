According to the provided ROS log messages, the robot did not successfully reach any of the waypoints. The logs show two attempts:

1. **Waypoint 1 (x=6.0, y=-2.0)**:
   - The robot transitioned to "ACTIVE" and attempted to navigate.
   - Got the error "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
   - Executed rotate recovery behavior but failed to find a valid plan.
   - Finally, "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found," and transitioned to "DONE."

2. **Waypoint 2 (x=-8.0, y=5.0)**:
   - The robot again transitioned to "ACTIVE" and attempted to navigate.
   - Encountered the same issue: "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
   - Executed rotate recovery behavior but, like before, failed to find a valid plan.
   - It also ended with "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found," and transitioned to "DONE."

Therefore, based on the log messages, the robot did not reach any waypoints.
