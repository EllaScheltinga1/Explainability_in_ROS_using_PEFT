The log messages do not indicate that the robot successfully reached any waypoint. The given log shows that the robot attempted to reach waypoint 1 (coordinates: x=7.0, y=-2.0) but ultimately failed. The relevant messages are:

1. "Sending goal 1 to move_base: x=7.0, y=-2.0"
2. "Navigating to waypoint 1..."
3. "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal."
4. "Rotate recovery behavior started."
5. "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors"
6. "Failed to reach waypoint 1."

Therefore, the last waypoint the robot attempted to reach but could not was waypoint 1. The logs do not indicate any successful navigation to a different or previous waypoint before this attempt.
