The log messages indicate that the robot attempted to reach a waypoint with coordinates \(x = -6.0, y = -10.0\) but failed because the goal was off the global costmap and a valid plan could not be found despite executing recovery behaviors. There is no information about successfully reaching a previous waypoint in the provided log messages. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the last waypoint the robot successfully reached.
