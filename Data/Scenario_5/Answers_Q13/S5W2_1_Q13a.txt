The log messages indicate that the paths generated by the robot's navigation system were not feasible due to the following reasons:

1. **Goal Off the Global Costmap:** 
   - For the first goal (`x=-1.0, y=5.0`), the message "The goal sent to the global planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal." indicates that the specified goal lies outside the area covered by the robot's global costmap. The global costmap is used for planning paths, and if the goal is outside this mapped area, the planner cannot generate a valid path.

2. **Recovery Behavior and Failures:**
   - The logs also mention, "Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors," which shows that despite attempting various recovery strategies (like clearing the costmaps and performing rotate recovery), the planner still couldn't find a valid path. This could be due to obstacles, dynamic changes in the environment, or inadequate map data for that specific region.

These issues prevented the robot from navigating to some waypoints, particularly waypoint 1.
