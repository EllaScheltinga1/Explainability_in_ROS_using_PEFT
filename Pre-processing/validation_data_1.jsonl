This action is likely intended to remove obstacles from the costmaps that may no longer be present, helping the planner determine a new feasible path.\n\n3. **Recovery Strategies:** At one point, the `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected a possible oscillation (repetitive, unproductive movement) either in the robot or its local planning. As part of the recovery from this oscillation, the planner activated a strategy where it preferred the current turning direction during optimization.\n\n4. **Path Resetting:** The `TebLocalPlannerROS` noted \"trajectory is not feasible\" multiple times and reset the planner to seek new solutions.\n\nDespite these efforts, the robot was unable to find or execute a feasible trajectory to both waypoint 2 and waypoint 3, leading to failure in reaching these specific goals."}]}

Below are detailed explanations based on the ROS log messages:\n\n1. **New Obstacle Detection**:\n   - Log: \"New obstacle detected at position (-4.0, 0.0)\"\n   - Explanation: The robot detected a new obstacle at a specific position. This likely required the path to be replanned for safe navigation.\n\n2. **Path Replanning**:\n   - Log: \"Robot is nearing the obstacle. Path is being replanned.\"\n   - Explanation: As the robot approached the detected obstacle, the navigation system initiated a path replanning process to find an alternative route.\n\n3. **Trajectory Infeasibility**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\"\n   - Explanation: The `TebLocalPlannerROS` detected that the planned trajectory was not feasible, possibly due to the inability to navigate around the obstacle within dynamic constraints. This necessitated resetting the path planner.\n\n4. **Oscillation Detection and Recovery**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: possible oscillation (of the robot or its local plan) detected. Activating recovery strategy (prefer current turning direction during optimization).\"\n   - Explanation: The system detected oscillation, which indicates repeated failed attempts to navigate past an obstacle or difficulty in maintaining a stable path. In response, a recovery strategy was activated to favor the current turning direction during optimization in an attempt to stabilize the navigation process.\n\n5. **Continued Infeasibility of Trajectories**:\n   - Log: \"TebLocalPlannerROS: trajectory is not feasible. Resetting planner...\"\n   - Explanation: Despite the recovery efforts, the planner again found the trajectory infeasible. This repeated infeasibility suggests that the obstacles or the environment posed significant challenges to path planning.\n\n6. **Failure to Reach Waypoint 2**:\n   - Log: \"Failed to reach waypoint 2.\"\n   - Explanation: All efforts to replan the path to waypoint 2 failed, likely because of the persistent obstacles and possibly due to complex or dynamically changing environments.\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of one or more paths was primarily due to the detection of new obstacles, resulting oscillations, and the inability of the path planner to find a feasible alternative route despite repeated attempts and recovery strategies."}]}

This is a common practice to handle potentially stale or incorrect obstacle data. The repeated clearing suggests that the robot encountered obstacles or environmental data that it couldn't navigate around.\n\n2. **Rotate Recovery Behavior**: The logs indicate that the \"rotate recovery behavior\" was initiated during attempts to reach both waypoints 1 and 2. This behavior typically tries to re-orient the robot to escape from difficult or stuck scenarios, indicating that the robot was having significant trouble in those areas.\n\n3. **Failed to Get a Plan**: On multiple occasions, the log states \"Failed to get a plan.\" This shows that the path planning algorithms (likely using A* or Dijkstra's algorithm) were unable to generate a viable path given the current map and sensor data, reinforcing that there may have been either insurmountable obstacles, incorrect map data, or dynamic changes in the environment making path planning infeasible.\n\n4. **Final Abort Decision**: After executing all available recovery behaviors, the system still failed to obtain a valid plan, leading to the decisions to abort. This corroborates the likelihood of complex, unresolvable environmental conditions or data inconsistencies.\n\nThe successful navigation to waypoint 3 implies that the area en route to this waypoint was less complicated, allowing the planning algorithms to generate a feasible path.\n\nIn summary, the infeasibility of paths to waypoints 1 and 2 is due to the presence of obstacles, potentially out-of-date or erroneous map data, or dynamic environmental changes which the robot's recovery behaviors were unable to handle."}]}
